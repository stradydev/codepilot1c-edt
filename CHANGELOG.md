## [Unreleased] — branch `pd/mcp-bridge-lite`

### Round-13 (2026-08-10) — three "silent" answers off the bus: two were real, one had already been fixed

Twelve feedback notes arrived on the bus (retro window 2026-08-03…08, back-filled from task
retrospectives). Three were taken first and each was probed live on the sandbox EDT
(`workspace-sandbox`, build `0.1.7.20260804-1700`, projects `Accounting management` + `TestConfiguration`)
**before** any code was touched. That order paid for itself: one of the three was already closed, and
another turned out to be a different defect than the one reported.

* **`get_diagnostics severity=error` was a no-op — it returned every warning too.** Reported as
  "`scope=file` leaks project-wide results when `severity=error` is set". Live, `scope=file` filters by
  file correctly under any severity; what broke is the severity gate itself. `parseSeverity` had no
  `case "error"` branch, so the value fell through `default -> Severity.INFO` — a regression from
  `6fa4cf7` (2026-02-15), which changed that default from `ERROR` to `INFO` without adding the explicit
  branch. Probed on `Documents/TimeSheet/ObjectModule.bsl`: `severity=error` and `severity=info` returned
  byte-identical answers, 2 errors **and** 98 warnings each. Since `scope=file` draws from a project-wide
  runtime-marker stream narrowed only by a token heuristic, the unfiltered tail is what the caller read as
  "project-wide". The rule now lives in `DiagnosticSeverityFilter` (core, unit-tested) because the UI
  bundle has no test runtime; the tool only maps the level onto its enum.
* **The same call could also under-report errors.** In `collectRuntimeFileMarkers` the severity gate sat
  *inside* `forEach`, after `.limit(preLimit)`, so on a warning-heavy module the scan budget was spent on
  markers that were then discarded. The gate moves into the stream ahead of the limit; the `sevDrop`
  counter is unchanged.
* **`grep`'s default corpus silently excluded 1C metadata.** Confirmed deterministically: searching
  `GroupResponsibleTreasury` (an item name in `Catalogs/BankAccounts/Forms/ItemForm/Form.form`) returned
  `(no matches)`, while the same search with `file_pattern='*.form'` returned both hits. The default
  whitelist was `.bsl/.os/.java/.xml` — `.form`, `.mdo`, `.dcs`, `.rights` were never opened, and the zero
  said nothing about it. The corpus now includes the metadata sources, extension matching is
  case-insensitive, a path-shaped glob (`**/*.form`) matches on its last segment instead of rejecting
  everything, and a comma-separated list is accepted. Every zero-match answer now states which corpus was
  actually read. The companion complaint in the same note — a plain `MessageToUser` missing from `.bsl` —
  **does not reproduce**: it is found normally.
* **`edt_metadata_details` on `Role.*`/`ScheduledJob.*` was already fixed.** `Role.Accountant`,
  `Role.Administration`, `ScheduledJob.AlertMailing`, `ScheduledJob.UpdatingRates` and
  `ScheduledJob.ImportGames` all resolve in full — the kind→collection mapping landed in `7884add`
  (2026-07-28), after the sessions the note was back-filled from. What survives is the note's actual ask:
  the miss message conflated three causes. An unrecognized type token (`NotAKind.Whatever`) now says so
  explicitly instead of answering `Object not found`, a supported kind states that it *was* searched, and
  the message names the project — the two live reports both turned out to be objects belonging to a
  different project, which reads identically to a missing object.
* Tests: `DiagnosticSeverityFilterTest` (6), `GrepFileFilterTest` (10), `MetadataDetailsFqnRejectionTest`
  (7, four of them new — the two that pinned the old terse wording were rewritten). Build green
  (`-Plocal-target`), 23/23 in `surefire-reports`, new build `0.1.7.20260810-0639`.
* **Status: LIVE-VALIDATED 2026-08-10**, build `0.1.7.20260810-0639`, sandbox EDT on the same two projects
  that produced the pre-fix reproductions. `get_diagnostics(scope=file, severity=error)` now answers
  *2 errors, 0 warnings* (207 chars) where `severity=info` still answers *2 errors, 98 warnings*
  (2658 chars) — before the fix both were the same 2658-char answer. `grep` finds
  `GroupResponsibleTreasury` in the `.form` with no `file_pattern` at all, `**/*.form` resolves instead of
  matching nothing, and a genuine zero now carries the corpus line. `edt_metadata_details` answers
  `NotAKind.Whatever` with *Unsupported metadata kind* and `Catalog.NoSuchThingHere` with a miss that
  names the project, while `Role.Accountant`/`ScheduledJob.UpdatingRates` still resolve in full. No
  regression on plain code search: `MessageToUser` still returns 50 `.bsl` hits (the cap), i.e. the wider
  corpus does not crowd out code matches.

### Round-14 (2026-08-10) — `yaxunit_run`: a zero-test run blamed the infobase for something the filter had done (Q90)

* **`classifyZeroTests` checked the equality state before the filter, so `NOT_EQUAL` always won.** Rerouted
  from `infra-fleet-tooling` as "`yaxunit_warmup`/`yaxunit_run` hard-gate on `equality_state==EQUAL`". Two
  corrections from the code: there is no `yaxunit_warmup` tool — the word does not occur in this repository,
  it is a step of the infra rail (`scripts/setup/Provision-Task.ps1`, `Step-YaxunitWarmup`) that calls
  `yaxunit_run`; and `yaxunit_run` never gated the run at all — it executes under any state, a stale one only
  adds a `preflight_warnings` line. The state decided exactly one thing: how a run that executed **zero**
  tests was explained.
* **That is what broke provisioning.** The warm-up step passes a deliberately nonexistent module
  (`__InfraWarmupProbe__`) and accepts `reason=filter_matched_nothing` as its proof that the thin client
  resolved, connected and ran — the filter is BSL-side discovery, so a zero match is the expected clean
  answer. With `NOT_EQUAL` the tool answered `infobase_stale` instead, the step saw an unrecognized reason,
  and the pipeline stopped on its first failure.
* **The ordering was wrong on its own terms, not merely inconvenient for that consumer.** A non-EQUAL state
  does not prove the infobase lacks the tests: an exclusive apply that reported `schema_applied:true` with no
  `dynamic_only` leaves EDT's comparison on `NOT_EQUAL` with live code — `EdtUpdateInfobaseTool` and
  `get_infobase_sync_state` both already warn about this and tell callers not to loop. So `infobase_stale`
  was a guess presented as the cause, and its remediation ("run update_infobase, then retry") cannot
  converge. The reason now names what was *observed* — a filter was passed and selected nothing — while the
  stale hypothesis stays in the message, in `equality_state` and in `preflight_warnings`, with the
  non-convergence case spelled out. No change is required on the infra side.
* **Not done, and why:** the tool cannot consume `schema_applied` by itself. That field exists only in
  `update_infobase`'s JSON answer and nothing persists it, so "read the same signal" is unimplementable
  without new state; an explicit "this NOT_EQUAL is known-cosmetic" assertion would want a parameter.
* Reproduced live before the fix (sandbox, `Accounting management` on `File_am_sandbox`, genuinely
  `NOT_EQUAL`): the synthetic-filter run came back `status=no_tests_matched`, `reason=infobase_stale` — the
  exact pair the infra step rejects. Tests: `YaxunitRunToolTest` 20/20, the stale-blame case rewritten.
* **Status: LIVE-VALIDATED 2026-08-10**, build `0.1.7.20260810-0712`, same sandbox and the same genuinely
  `NOT_EQUAL` infobase, same synthetic filter (`__InfraWarmupProbe__`) — a before/after pair on one stand,
  with only the build changed. `reason` is now `filter_matched_nothing` where it was `infobase_stale`, while
  `status=no_tests_matched` and `equality_state=NOT_EQUAL` are unchanged: the ordering was corrected without
  suppressing the stale signal. The message still carries the stale hypothesis and the non-convergence
  advisory, and the verdict stays on the error channel — zero tests means no verdict, per the test-runner
  channel contract. This is the pair `Step-YaxunitWarmup` accepts as proof the thin client resolved and ran.
* Not re-run: a live suite with a filter that actually matches. `classifyZeroTests` is reachable only when
  zero tests executed, so a passing run cannot enter the changed branch; `YaxunitRunToolTest` covers the
  branch by result rather than by source text.

### Round-21 (2026-08-10) — `create_metadata kind=CommonModule` stops creating a module the platform calls invalid

* **A CommonModule created without properties was born broken.** With no environment flags supplied, all
  four stay at the ecore default `false`, and EDT answers on the spot with four `md-legacy-emf-check`
  errors («No one environment is not set», one per property) plus a `common-module-type` code-style error.
  `md-legacy-emf-check` is EDT core, not a style rule — a module with no environment at all is invalid by
  the platform model itself. Every caller had to know to repair the object it had just been told was
  created successfully; `author_yaxunit_tests` already carried exactly that repair as a follow-up
  `update_metadata`.
* **Fixed by defaulting to EDT's own canonical «Server module».** `clientOrdinaryApplication`, `server`
  and `externalConnection` true, everything else false — read off `com.e1c.v8codestyle.md.CommonModuleTypes.SERVER`
  rather than guessed, and confirmed live: setting exactly those cleared all five diagnostics on the probe
  module, and the `.mdo` recorded them.
* **An explicit choice by the caller is never widened.** The gate is all-or-nothing: naming any one
  environment flag suppresses the default entirely, because a caller who asked for a client module must not
  receive a server module with client bolted on. `serverCall` deliberately does *not* count as an
  environment — the check does not accept it in place of one, and a server-call module needs `server`
  anyway, so `create(serverCall=true)` now yields a valid module instead of the all-false one. The default
  is also applied *before* the caller's properties, so an explicit value lands last and wins even if the
  gate were ever wrong about a key.
* `author_yaxunit_tests` now states its client+server environment at creation instead of creating an
  invalid module and amending it, so its result is unchanged by the new default and the module is never
  momentarily something else. The follow-up `update_metadata` stays for the `existing` branch.
* Tests: `CommonModuleDefaultsTest` 9/9 against the real decision function — including that the default
  always sets at least one environment, and that the gate matches the same key spellings
  `create_metadata` resolves (`client_managed_application`, `external-connection`). Live validation
  pending the next sandbox redeploy. The pre-fix reading is in
  `issues/2026-08-10-new-module-staleness-probe-findings.md`.

### Round-20 (2026-08-10) — `bsl_module_context`: the module kind is now derived, not read off an unset field

* **Every module kind came back `COMMON_MODULE`.** Found while reproducing Round-19: three different
  module kinds of one document (`ObjectModule.bsl`, `ManagerModule.bsl`, `Forms/DocumentForm/Module.bsl`)
  answered `COMMON_MODULE` with three different method counts — so the right file was read each time and
  only the kind was wrong. A form module reported as a common module misleads exactly the caller who asked
  in order to decide what is legal in that module (`&AtClient`, event handlers, export rules).
* **The field was never an answer.** `Module.moduleType` is a plain stored EMF attribute whose default is
  `COMMON_MODULE` (confirmed in `ModuleImpl`: a bare getter over a field, no derivation), and the only
  thing that assigns it is EDT's derived-state computer — which never runs for a module this bundle takes
  straight from the parser. So the tool was reporting the untouched default for all sixteen kinds.
* **Fixed by deriving the kind the way EDT does, not by inventing a path table.** `BslModuleTypeResolver`
  delegates to `BslUtil.computeModuleType`, EDT's own FQN-keyed mapping, reached through the
  `IQualifiedNameFilePathConverter` from the BSL language injector (with a non-blocking OSGi service
  lookup as the second source). The literals therefore cannot drift from EDT's — the issue note had
  parked the obvious path-table fix precisely because the spellings could not be guessed, and the enum
  confirms why: it is `RECORDSET_MODULE`, not `RECORD_SET_MODULE`.
* **A kind that cannot be derived is now reported as unknown rather than as `COMMON_MODULE`.** When no
  converter is reachable, the stored value is passed on only where it can still be true — under
  `CommonModules/`, or when the caller gave no path to contradict it. Any other path carrying the default
  is an unset field, and the field is omitted instead of asserting a kind the module demonstrably lacks.
  So even total derivation failure is no worse than before on correctness.
* Tests: `BslModuleTypeResolverTest` 13/13, and behavioural rather than source-contract — each case drives
  the real `BslUtil.computeModuleType` through a converter stub, so what is pinned is EDT's mapping and
  the platform-path shape it is fed, not a local copy of either. Live validation pending the next sandbox
  redeploy; the pre-fix reading is recorded in
  `issues/2026-08-10-bsl-module-context-moduletype-always-common-module.md`.

### Round-19 (2026-08-10) — `bsl_object_context`: the "missing" modules were a doubled `src/` prefix

* **Every module of an object whose files exist came back `status: missing`.** Reported for
  `Document.CasinoCashflowTransactions` (feedback `2026-08-08-bsl-object-context-false-missing-modules-existing-files`,
  back-filled from BF-7805) and reproduced verbatim on the sandbox: both modules `missing / File not
  found: src/Documents/CasinoCashflowTransactions/ObjectModule.bsl`, while `glob` listed the file at
  exactly that path. The note guessed at a rooting divergence from `glob`/`grep`; the cause is smaller and
  entirely inside the plugin.
* **`BslModuleRequest.filePath` is documented as relative to `src/` and `resolveSourceFile` adds that
  segment itself** — the aggregator prepended `src/` on top of it. So the lookup asked for
  `src/src/Documents/…` while the error message printed `request.getFilePath()`, the single-prefixed path.
  That mismatch is what made the report read as impossible: the named path really does exist, it just was
  not the one being checked. Confirmed from both sides through the MCP endpoint before the fix —
  `bsl_module_context` with the unprefixed path answered with 8 methods, with the prefix it produced the
  reported error word for word.
* **Also fixed the wider footgun the same bug exposes: a path pasted from `glob` now resolves.** `glob`
  prints `src/`-prefixed paths, so handing one to any BSL tool dead-ended in `FILE_NOT_FOUND` naming a
  path that plainly exists, with nothing in the message hinting at the prefix. `resolveSourceFile` now
  tries the documented spelling first and the already-prefixed reading as a fallback
  (`SourceFilePathCandidates`, core, 9 tests) — order chosen so that everything resolving today keeps
  resolving. `src` alone and a folder merely starting with those letters (`srcgen/…`) are not treated as
  the prefix.
* Tests: `SourceFilePathCandidatesTest` 9/9, by result. Live validation pending the next sandbox
  redeploy — the pre-fix reproduction is already recorded above.

### Round-18 (2026-08-10) — `get_diagnostics baseline`: the diff rule is now reachable from the tool

* **`baseline` = `off` | `save` | `diff`.** Round-16 implemented and tested the rule in core but left it
  unwired, so the token-volume feedback note was only half answered. `save` records the current
  diagnostics of a scope, `diff` then reports only what that snapshot does not already account for —
  which is what "did my change add anything" costs on a configuration with ~6.4k baseline errors.
* **A baseline always scans the whole scope; the caller's `max_items` is applied afterwards, to what
  survived the diff.** Limiting first would diff against a truncated scan: the snapshot would miss
  everything past the cut and report it as new on the very next call. `save` therefore overrides
  `max_items` outright and the note says so — the same ordering lesson as moving the path filter before
  the limit in Round-16, where the severity gate had been wrong in exactly this way until `5a851a7`.
* **The counts are recomputed from the reported subset** with the collector's own origin-aware helper, so
  a diff cannot show three items under the project's full error total.
* **A filtered answer never looks like a clean one.** Every path appends a note: how many pre-existing
  items were hidden and the snapshot's stamp; that nothing is recorded yet on a first `diff`; that
  `max_items` lost to a `save`. A storage failure reports the scan in full and says the filter did not
  run — the one outcome worth engineering against is a full report that READS as a diff.
* **Snapshots live in `<workspace>/.codepilot/diagnostics-baseline/<scope>.txt`**, one per project or
  file, chosen over hidden plugin state so a stale baseline is a file you can look at and delete.
  `DiagnosticBaselineStore` (UI) does the I/O and nothing else; the file name is core
  (`storageFileName`), where it is tested — every separator maps to `_`, so no scope key can escape the
  directory, and long keys get a hash suffix so two of them cannot collapse onto one snapshot.
* Tests: `DiagnosticBaselineTest` grows from 11 to 20, covering the file name, the traversal property and
  each note's promise. Live validation pending the next sandbox redeploy.

### Round-17 (2026-08-10) — `delete_metadata`: the non-`force` top-level delete was unreachable, and the report that turned out to be my own reading mistake

* **A top-level object could never be deleted without `force=true`.** The gate read
  `if (!topLevelDelete && references.total() == 0) return;` — it returned early only for CHILD deletes,
  so a top-level delete threw `METADATA_DELETE_CONFLICT` whatever the reference count. Proven live on
  the sandbox (build `0.1.7.20260810-0712`, `TestConfiguration`) with the cheapest possible case: a
  brand-new `SessionParameter` created through the normal `create_metadata` path — no module, no
  children, no user of any kind — refused with exactly ONE cited reference,
  `Configuration#sessionParameters`, its own entry in the configuration composition. A `CommonModule`
  behaved the same and additionally cited `CommonModule.<Name>#source`, its own module. Since every
  top-level object is listed in `Configuration#<collection>` by construction, no amount of cleaning
  could reach the cure the message advertised (*«Сначала очистите ссылки… затем повторите удаление»*),
  which left `force=true` as the only way through and taught callers to pass the override reflexively —
  the opposite of what a guard is for.
* **`DeleteReferenceScope` (core, pure logic) drops the references that die with the object** before
  counting: the object's own subtree (the referrer's top object IS the target) and its own composition
  membership (`content` plus `TopLevelCollections.configurationTag(kind)` — one source of truth, reused,
  not a second copy). The gate now lets the count decide for top-level objects too, and the refusal text
  no longer claims a categorical policy is a reference condition.
* **The filter names the composition feature instead of exempting the whole `Configuration`** — and that
  distinction is the point. `Configuration#defaultRoles` pointing at a Role and `#defaultLanguage` at a
  Language are real users that the delete does NOT clean up; waving them through would trade this bug
  for dangling `.mdo` lines, the failure mode `removeSubsystemLinks` was written to prevent. Half the
  test suite is that anti-regression half. Every uncertainty — unknown kind, blank feature name, a
  feature that does not match the mapping — resolves to "this reference blocks", so a wrong mapping entry
  can only restore the old over-strict behaviour, never permit a silent delete of a referenced object.
* **The `recursive=true` refusal now names what it found** (`Found: feature(Type), feature×N`). A bare
  `CommonModule` demands `recursive=true` because `hasNestedMetadataChildren` walks every containment
  feature; a `SessionParameter` does not. Which intrinsic containment causes it was NOT established, so
  it is deliberately not fixed blind — excluding the wrong one would let a real child be deleted without
  `recursive`. The named refusal is the better message anyway and lets the next live `CommonModule`
  delete identify the feature by itself, with no diagnostic-only build round.
* **`get_diagnostics` answering about the wrong project *silently* on a misspelled selector: retracted,
  no defect.** Filed by me in `issues/2026-08-10-sandbox-probe-findings.md` during Round-15. Re-probed on
  `0712`: `projectName='TestConfiguration'` does answer about `/Accounting management`, but the response
  carries the advisory note in full, naming the ignored key and suggesting `project_name`.
  `AdvisoryToolWrapper` is applied by `ToolRegistry.register`, unchanged since `99f4db0`, so build `0639`
  behaved identically. The note sits at the END of the report and I read only its head — the whole
  response is ~15k characters. Third instance of a conclusion resting on the ABSENCE of an observation;
  the issues file now records the retraction rather than being deleted.
* Tests: `DeleteReferenceScopeTest` 20/20, by result over the function rather than by source text, with
  both live samples asserted verbatim. Live validation of the delete path pending the next sandbox
  redeploy.

### Round-16 (2026-08-10) — `get_diagnostics`: narrowing a project scan, and the one report that was already closed

* **`path_contains` narrows a scan to named modules/areas** (`DiagnosticPathFilter` in core,
  `EdtDiagnosticsCollector.applyPathFilter`). Two feedback notes asked for the same thing from different
  sessions: a project-wide `severity=error max_items=0` returned ~6.7k baseline errors just to confirm
  "nothing new mentions my objects". Comma-separated, case-insensitive, either slash accepted, matched
  against the file path **or** the object presentation — the latter matters because runtime-marker items,
  which are the bulk of a project scan, frequently carry no file path at all and name their subject only
  as e.g. `CommonModule.Error.Module`; filtering on the path alone would drop exactly what the feature
  exists to find. An item carrying neither coordinate is dropped when narrowing is requested, because it
  cannot be shown to belong to the named area.
* **Placed before the `max_items` cut, at all four collection sites.** Filtering after the limit would
  narrow a set that had already been truncated, so a question about one module in a 6000-error project
  would return whatever survived the cut. The severity gate was wrong in exactly this way until
  `5a851a7`; the limit is now consistently the last step.
* **The baseline-diff rule is implemented and unit-tested in core (`DiagnosticBaseline`), not yet wired
  into the tool.** The fingerprint deliberately excludes the line number and carries multiplicity
  instead — including the line would report a module's whole tail as "new" after one inserted procedure.
  The documented cost: the diff answers "are there more of these than before", not "is this the same
  one". An unknown `baseline` mode resolves to `off`, never to `diff`, so a typo cannot silently hide
  diagnostics.
* **`get_diagnostics scope=file path=… severity=error` returning project-wide results: already fixed, not
  reproducible.** Reported in the same batch (BF-12338 item 1). Probed live on build
  `0.1.7.20260810-0712` before touching anything: on a file with 8 errors in a project with 16, the call
  returns 8 and the header names the file. `severity=error` and `severity=info` agree where the file has
  no warnings and differ where it does. This was a consequence of the `severity=error` no-op regression
  closed by `5a851a7` — whose own javadoc already records that callers read that bug as "scope=file
  leaked project-wide results". No code change.
* Tests: `DiagnosticPathFilterTest` 8/8, `DiagnosticBaselineTest` 11/11, both by result rather than by
  source text. Live validation of `path_contains` pending the next sandbox redeploy.

### Round-15 (2026-08-10) — `create_metadata adopt_existing`: the orphan path was live-validated on the sandbox after all (BF-13405)

* **Status: LIVE-VALIDATED 2026-08-10**, sandbox EDT (`workspace-sandbox`, build `0.1.7.20260810-0639`,
  project `TestConfiguration`). No stack, no provisioned infobase, no `File_am_BF-13405`.
* **The 2026-07-28 entry above is corrected: "the two-index desync cannot be synthesised" is wrong.** That
  wave delegated the `adopt_existing` orphan path to "the stacks that hold the fixtures" on the grounds that
  the A/B desync was not reproducible locally. It is reproducible, and the recipe follows directly from the
  mechanism that same entry documents — index **B** registers every `.mdo` on disk regardless of whether
  `Configuration.mdo` mentions it. So: write a `CommonModule` `.mdo` (+ `Module.bsl`) into
  `src/CommonModules/<Name>/` **bypassing the plugin**, then refresh the project. The write must bypass the
  plugin because `write_file` correctly refuses `.mdo` files and refuses to create new files at all — and
  bypassing is the faithful reproduction anyway, since the real orphan comes from a merge or a partial
  import, not from a tool call. `get_diagnostics(scope=project)` is a convenient refresh: it calls
  `refreshLocal(DEPTH_INFINITE)` on the project.
* **Confirmed live, end to end:** the desync presents exactly as reported (`edt_metadata_details` →
  `exists:false` while `create_metadata` → `METADATA_ALREADY_EXISTS`), and the refusal names the cure
  precisely, including that `adopt_existing:true` must also be passed in the `edt_validate_request` payload.
  With `adopt_existing=true` the object is registered into `Configuration.commonModules`
  (`adopted:true`, `registered_into` echoed) and afterwards resolves through `edt_metadata_details` **under
  its original uuid** — proof it adopted the existing top object rather than authoring a new one. The
  adopted `.mdo` is not mutated: uuid and synonym survive untouched, matching the documented contract that
  `properties` are ignored on adoption.
* **EOL guard covers the adoption path.** Checked deliberately, because adoption rewrites `Configuration.mdo`
  and the sandbox project happens to be mixed-EOL (its `Configuration.mdo` is CRLF, its `Error.mdo` is LF), so
  a first reading proved nothing. `Configuration.mdo` was normalised to LF and a second orphan adopted: the
  file stayed LF (0 CRLF pairs) and grew by exactly the one `<commonModules>` line. No flip.
* Both probes were removed afterwards (`delete_metadata`, and see the next bullet for why it needed two
  overrides); `Configuration.mdo` is back to its original 57 lines, 2 `<commonModules>` entries against 2
  directories on disk, CRLF restored.
* **Two defects observed while doing this, filed in `issues/2026-08-10-sandbox-probe-findings.md`, not fixed
  here:** `get_diagnostics` silently ignores a misspelled `projectName` and answers about the *default*
  project instead (the unknown-parameter note that other tools emit is not wired for it — a wrong-project
  answer presented as correct), and `delete_metadata` counts an object's own `Configuration#commonModules`
  membership and its own `#source` as blocking references, which may make the non-`force` top-level delete
  path unreachable in general.

### Round-12 (2026-08-04) — `web_publication`: the wsap pin and the publication list both told the truth about a model nobody refreshed (BF-13525)

* **`wsap_version` now pins the module FILE, not the platform's `bin` directory** (`703de23`). Reported off
  stack-1: `publish` returned `ok`, the next `restart` died with `httpd exited immediately with code 1`, and the
  Apache error log stayed empty — the classic signature of a conf that fails to parse before logging starts. The
  conf carried `LoadModule _1cws_module "C:\Program Files\1cv8\8.3.27.2074\bin"`. `IRuntimeComponent.getLocation()`
  is that directory, and it holds every wsap flavour at once (`wsapch2.dll`, `wsap22.dll`, `wsap24.dll` side by
  side), while `ApachePublishDelegateWin32.formatPathToWebExtensionComponent` only quotes what it is handed. EDT's
  own reader states the expected shape — its `RUNTIME_PATH` pattern matches only a path ending in
  `wsap*|wsisapi.(dll|so)`. The component is an `ILaunchableRuntimeComponent` whose `getFile()` IS the module, so
  that is the primary resolution now, with a by-name fallback mirroring EDT's `IRuntimeComponentFileNames` table.
  A platform installed without the web-server extension component now fails with a structured
  `WEB_EXTENSION_NOT_FOUND` naming the directory searched, instead of writing a conf that stops Apache.
* **`get`/`list`/`remove` read the conf instead of a snapshot frozen before the publish** (`703de23`). Same
  session, same stand: an alias Apache had been serving for hours answered `PUBLICATION_NOT_FOUND`, with `list`
  returning `[]`, while the `Alias` block sat in `httpd-1c.conf` untouched. `PublicationManager.getAll` never
  consults the delegate — it serves a per-`WebServer` EMF Resource filled once via `computeIfAbsent` and dropped
  only by the manager's own `firePublishedEvent`/`firePublicationRemovedEvent`. Publishing here has to bypass the
  manager (it hands the delegate a `null` web-extension `Path`, an NPE for any vrd with `httpServices`), so those
  events never fired — and `publish`'s own pre-flight existence check ran first, freezing an EMPTY snapshot for
  the rest of the EDT session. Every read now goes to the delegate, which re-parses the conf per call; `publish`
  additionally pokes the manager's invalidation hook best-effort so EDT's own publication editor stops showing the
  pre-publish state. `getPublicationUrl` leaves the manager for the same reason, plus its `publicationUris` key
  compares its own publication name to itself (`PublicationKey.equals`). Alias matching now strips a leading slash
  as well as a trailing one — the conf writes `Alias "/name"`, the model may store `name/`, the schema documents
  the bare alias.
* **Status: LIVE-VALIDATED 2026-08-04**, build `0.1.7.20260804-1700`, stack-1 / `Apache-stack-1`, all three
  scenarios PASS (run by `infra-bf13525` on alias `edt-fix-validate`). `publish` with `wsap_version` wrote
  `…\bin\wsap24.dll` — the file, not the directory — and came back `restarted:true` / `probe_status:200`;
  `list`/`get` right after the publish in the SAME EDT session returned the publication (the exact pair that
  used to answer `[]` / `PUBLICATION_NOT_FOUND`); `remove` took the alias down with no manual conf editing
  (`removed:true`, probe on the removed alias → 404). Build green, 14 plain-JUnit cases green (resolution
  table, shared `bin` directory, already-a-file and missing-module paths, alias forms).
* **Bystander note, verified in the decompile after the live run flagged it:** `remove` also drops the
  `LoadModule _1cws_module` line — but only when the publication it removes was the conf's LAST 1C one.
  `ConfigUpdate.update` re-scans every surviving `<Directory>` for `SetHandler 1c-application`
  (`checkForV8Publication`) and writes the remembered module line back when it finds one, so removing one alias
  from a multi-publication Apache does not break the others. EDT behaviour, not ours; recorded because the
  fleet's Apache does host several aliases.

### Round-11 (2026-07-29) — `update_infobase` stops calling a deferred schema an update (BF-12843)

* **The non-convergence advisory stopped blaming a dynamic apply** (`6e29ddb`). Raised by the orchestrator off
  the live run, and truer than it looked: `equality_state_after_warning` fires only when `dynamic_only` was NOT
  set — the apply DID take the exclusive lock — yet it advised "apply one EXCLUSIVE update", which the caller had
  already done, and read as "your update was probably dynamic". That false lead cost a round on 2026-07-30 and
  nearly caused a correct feedback note to be rewritten. The warning now states what the branch knows: the apply
  was exclusive, another one will not converge anything, `schema_applied` is true, and it is EDT's comparison that
  has not converged — plus that anything gating on `work_ready`/EQUAL will spin forever there. The read side
  (`get_infobase_sync_state`) keeps both hypotheses, since it cannot see the flag, but now names `dynamic_only`
  as the field that decides between them instead of guessing at the likelier one.
* **Live-validation status, partly closed 2026-07-30** on a real 1.51 GB file infobase (stack-1, build
  `0.1.7.20260729-2134`). **Confirmed:** `schema_applied` is present on every outcome — verified on four
  distinct paths (async acceptance `false`, in-job error `false`, synchronous refusal `false`, exclusive apply
  `true`) — and an exclusive apply reports `schema_applied:true` with `status:"updated"`. **Not exercised, and
  not exercisable on that stand:** the >660s blocking wait (the update now takes 3–4s there — the 13-minute
  window was that copy's FIRST full-schema update and is spent, and a short job cannot distinguish "ceiling
  raised" from "still 600, silently clamped"), the EQUAL-skip pair (the infobase never converges to EQUAL there,
  so `skip_if_current` correctly proceeds instead of skipping), and the dynamic-apply path (the exclusive lock
  was taken instantly both times). Validating the rest needs a fresh copy of a large infobase with an unapplied
  schema, not a dedicated stand.

* **The inline probe may borrow the connection string's login, and says when it did** (`1345a04`). Owner-approved
  2026-07-29 on the condition that a borrowed credential is never silent. `web_publication` ran its inline check
  unauthenticated whenever `probe_user` was absent, so a 1C HTTP/web service with mandatory auth answered 401 and
  read as a broken publication — even though the caller had already handed the tool an `infobase_connection`
  carrying `Usr=`/`Pwd=`. The check now falls back to that pair and reports `probe_credentials_source` plus which
  login answered; a 401 on a borrowed credential says so explicitly, because an infobase user and the endpoint's
  user need not be the same account. Both halves are required — a login without a password is not a usable Basic
  credential, and probing with half of one reproduces the same misdiagnosis. The token match is separator-anchored
  so `UsrExtra=` is not read as `Usr=`.

* **CONTRACT CHANGE — `dynamic_only:true` now implies `updated:false`, and `schema_applied` is always
  present** (`c8cc713`). A non-exclusive apply commits the stored configuration and defers the physical
  restructure; the payload used to answer `updated:true` beside `dynamic_only:true`, so the one flag every
  caller gates on said "done" for an infobase whose schema was not live. Measured live by the orchestrator on
  a 1.51 GB file infobase, and caught only because a human read the whole payload. The apply outcome now also
  carries `status:"partial"`. The CALL stays successful: a dynamic apply does land BSL code, so for a
  code-only update it is a complete result and an error channel would be a lie in the other direction — the
  hard failure stays bound to EDT's own verdict. `schema_applied` is on every outcome of the tool including
  errors and the async acceptance, so no caller has to read an absent field as a value; the EQUAL-skip is the
  case where it legitimately disagrees with `updated` (nothing applied, schema live).
* **A blocking status wait can now outlast the update it observes** (`c8cc713`). `update_infobase` permits
  `timeout_s` up to 1800s while `update_infobase_status(wait_for_completion=true)` capped its own wait at 600s
  under a 660s transport cap — so a healthy 13-minute update made the poller abort first and the caller report
  a false `failed`, a symptom indistinguishable from the client-side abort that `timeout_s` was added to fix.
  The tool's ceiling is now 1800s and its per-tool transport cap 1860s (`connect_infobase_status` keeps 660s).
  An expired wait already returned success with `timed_out:true`; it now also says which one expired and that
  this is not a verdict.
* **An empty Designer scan says so instead of omitting the key** (`c8cc713`). `PROCESS_TIMEOUT` surfaces the
  still-running Designer PIDs, but when the scan found none it dropped the field entirely — indistinguishable
  from a build predating the feature, which is how a retest reported the PID as "still absent from the payload"
  for a build that had carried it since `3ca38df`. The empty result is now explicit
  (`designer_scan: no_designer_bound_to_this_infobase`) and the message admits that a process whose command
  line cannot be read cannot be attributed to an infobase at all. Note for future detail fields: the error
  renderer is an allowlist — a detail key with no branch there never reaches the payload.

### Round-10 (2026-07-29) — the cascaded subtree also learns who its new owner is

* **A cascaded descendant's up-link now follows its owner too** (`fcc6c7b`). Round-9's cascade re-keyed every
  descendant's FQN, which made them addressable again, but each descendant's own `.mdo` carries
  `<parentSubsystem>` — the owner's STORAGE FQN, not a bare name — held as a proxy resolved against the chain
  the owner had BEFORE the move. Measured live on build `0.1.7.20260729-1206`, on the very build that fixed the
  re-keying: `WaveR9C.mdo` still read `<parentSubsystem>Subsystem.WaveR9P</parentSubsystem>` while the owner had
  become `Subsystem.WaveParent.Subsystem.WaveR9P`, and EDT rendered the up-link as a nameless stub.
  `SubsystemTree.Relocation` now carries the live object that will own each node, so the cascade hands
  `setParentSubsystem` the real parent rather than a recomputed string — the serializer writes whatever the
  reference resolves to. **Both** branches re-point, including the one where the FQN was already right: a
  descendant keyed correctly and pointed wrongly is exactly what an earlier cascade left behind, so that branch
  is how such a tree heals on a re-run. A failing up-link write is logged, not thrown — the re-registration has
  already made the object addressable, and aborting there would trade a wrong pointer for the unaddressable
  descendant the cascade exists to prevent.
* **The pointer decision stopped being made by leaf name** (`fcc6c7b`). Manual repair was a silent no-op:
  `reparentSubsystem` compared the dangling proxy against the live parent through the name-based identity, both
  read `waver9p`, the answer was "unchanged", and the write was skipped while `update_metadata` reported SUCCESS
  with the file untouched — another instance of "success = nothing happened". The decision now uses a CHAIN
  comparison (`SubsystemIdentity.chainOf` / `sameChain`: the live BM FQN where readable, the proxy URI where not).
  Membership tests keep the name-based identity unchanged, which is correct for them — inside one parent's
  collection the entries are proxies with nothing but a name to match on. The two rules are separately named on
  purpose: conflating them is what caused this. An unreadable chain matches nothing, so the caller writes the
  pointer — the repairing direction.
* **The subtree is walked even when the owner is already in its slot** (`27349cc`). The first live probe of the
  fix above changed nothing: `relocateSubsystemStorage` returned early on "owner already registered in the
  target slot", and did so BEFORE the descendant plan was built — so the whole subtree pass was gated on the
  OWNER's own FQN changing, which is false by definition in the case that needs healing. The healing branch was
  unreachable one level up; the plugin log said so plainly, reporting only the owner as co-edited. The plan is
  now built before that branch can return, and the branch runs the pass instead of returning bare. The pass is
  idempotent on FQNs, so a re-run costs one walk and writes only what is wrong.
* Tests by result: the stale-flat-vs-nested-live pair that fooled the name identity is now a regression test,
  alongside FQN→URI fallback, case-insensitivity, absence of prefix matching, and the unreadable-chain case.
  Source-contract additions pin only what no unit test can see — that BOTH branches re-point, that the gate is
  the chain comparison, and (after the live probe) that the subtree pass is not gated on the owner moving. The
  source-contract test that "both branches re-point" was green throughout while the method was unreachable:
  asserting the presence of text in a source file cannot see dead code.
* **Live-validated** on build `0.1.7.20260729-2109`, project `TestConfiguration`, reading the `.mdo` files
  rather than the tool's answer — the defect was precisely that the tool lied. Healing: `WaveR9C` went from
  `Subsystem.WaveR9P` to `Subsystem.WaveParent.Subsystem.WaveR9P` and `WaveR9G` from
  `Subsystem.WaveR9P.Subsystem.WaveR9C` to the full three-link chain. Forward: a fresh `WaveR10P > WaveR10C >
  WaveR10G` moved under `WaveParent` landed all three files at the nested path with every up-link carrying the
  full chain. The grandchild carrying the complete chain is what confirms the recursion hands down live owners
  rather than stale proxies. Both grandchildren still resolve by flat alias.
* **Owner decisions recorded** (`issues/2026-07-28-bus-drain-recon.md`): `queryText` auto-generated and always
  echoed in the summary; `mainTable` in, as its own commit; `fields`/`calculatedFields`/`parameters`/
  `listSettings` out of scope **with an honest refusal** rather than a silent drop; `set_attribute_props` to be
  added; `add_button` for object/common commands refused for now; `infobase_connection` credentials may be
  reused for the inline probe provided the summary says so.

### Round-9 (2026-07-29) — a move now takes the whole subtree, and a refuted rule stops being repeated

* **A moved subsystem re-registers every subsystem below it** (`00e8d16`). `updateTopObjectFqn` re-keys the ONE
  object it is handed, and a subsystem's children are separate top objects with chains of their own — so a move
  left every descendant registered under a chain whose root no longer existed. Measured live on build
  `0.1.7.20260729-1142`: `WaveR8P` holding `WaveR8C` moved under `WaveParent`, and afterwards
  `WaveR8P.subsystems` read back as a NAMELESS stub, `WaveR8C.mdo` sat inside the vacated directory, and
  `Subsystem.WaveR8C` answered *Object not found* to `edt_metadata_details` **and** to `update_metadata` —
  unaddressable, and unrepairable through any tool. Same corruption class as the half-linked move closed by
  `747d617`, one level down.
  The whole subtree's FQNs are now read **before** the owner moves and each descendant re-registered against the
  owner's new chain afterwards. That order is the fix, not a detail: `subsystems` down-links are bare names
  resolved against the owner's FQN, so a plan read after the move comes back empty and the cascade would
  silently do nothing. What the plan contains is decided by the EMF-free
  `SubsystemTree.descendantRelocations` and tested by result; each descendant's new FQN reaches the export and
  its vacated path the cleanup. A taken target slot aborts the move rather than leaving the tree half
  re-registered; a descendant that cannot follow (no readable name, not a BM object) keeps its old registration
  and is logged — which is now the reason Round-8's "other entries" guard exists, rather than "the move does not
  re-register children" as that entry put it.
  **Live-validated** on build `0.1.7.20260729-1206`, three levels deep on fresh objects: `WaveR9P > WaveR9C >
  WaveR9G` moved under `WaveParent`, all three addressable, all three `.mdo` at the nested paths, both
  down-links full chains, the old directory gone.
* **Known remaining, measured on that same run — closed in Round-10 above:** a cascaded descendant's own `<parentSubsystem>` still holds its
  parent's OLD FQN, so EDT renders the up-link as a nameless stub. Re-issuing `set.parentSubsystem` does **not**
  repair it — `reparentSubsystem` reads the dangling proxy as the current parent, `sameSubsystem` answers
  "unchanged", and the write is skipped while the tool reports success. The parent-side down-link is correct, so
  this is a half-linked state rather than a lost object. Diagnosis in `issues/2026-07-28-bus-drain-recon.md`.
* **Eight places stopped claiming a dotted subsystem FQN resolves nowhere** (`d914e10`, `00e8d16`). The sentence
  *"Subsystem FQNs are FLAT at any nesting depth … no dotted form built from the parent resolves, so never pass
  one"* was false in both halves. `Subsystem.<Parent>.Subsystem.<Name>` **is** the FQN a nested subsystem is
  registered under and the resolver takes it (`findNestedSubsystemAlias`); live-confirmed 2026-07-29 —
  `update_metadata` accepted `Subsystem.WaveParent.Subsystem.WaveR8P` and answered with it. The flat form is a
  name-based alias the forest walk supplies, refused as ambiguous when the name is not unique. Corrected in
  `update_metadata.target_fqn`, `edt_metadata_details.objectFqns`, `SubsystemTree.nestedFqnRejectionMessage`
  (which had been contradicting `describeAmbiguity` in the same class), `EdtMetadataInspectorService` (where
  flat-only is right for *that* tool but was stated as a property of the model), two `EdtMetadataService`
  javadocs — one of which invented a mechanism — and `TopLevelCollections`. Dropped outright from
  `add_metadata_child.parent_fqn`: none of its nine child kinds hangs off a Subsystem, so it was dead advice
  billed on every tool listing. `SubsystemFqnRejectionMessageTest` had been **asserting** the falsehood; it now
  pins that neither the original marker/name-pair dead end nor the over-corrected flat-only claim comes back.

### Round-8 (2026-07-29) — the relocation now takes its old file with it

* **A relocated subsystem no longer leaves a duplicate definition behind** (`998ad72`). Moving a subsystem
  re-keys its FQN and the export writes the `.mdo` at the new path; nothing removed the old file, so the
  configuration carried the definition twice and the next refresh would read the leftover as a second,
  top-level subsystem. The vacated FQN is only known inside the write transaction, so it now rides the sink the
  write chain already carries (`CoEditedSink`), and the cleanup runs after the export in all three flows that
  can relocate storage — `update_metadata`, `delete_metadata` (deleting a parent sends its children back to the
  root) and `create_metadata` (an ADOPTED orphan already has a `.mdo` on disk).
  What may be deleted is decided by the new `VacatedSubsystemStorage` over plain booleans and tested by result:
  the new descriptor must be on disk, or the vacated file is the only copy there is; and the old directory is
  spared whenever it holds anything else, because a subsystem's children are separate top objects that the move
  does not re-register — their files sit inside the directory being vacated. A move under one's own descendant
  is refused the directory removal for the same reason. Failure is never fatal: the move succeeded and the
  object is addressable, so a leftover is logged loudly rather than reported as a failed write.
  **Live-validated** on build `0.1.7.20260729-1142`: a fresh `WaveR7Child` moved under `WaveParent` left
  exactly one `.mdo` (`src/Subsystems/WaveParent/Subsystems/WaveR7Child/WaveR7Child.mdo`), the old
  `src/Subsystems/WaveR7Child/` is gone, and the log names what it removed.
* **`create_schema`'s diagnostic probe retired** (`1a30556`). `sameNameSchemaBound=` rode the `[dcs]` log line
  for one diagnostic round to settle whether a dangling `BasicTemplate.template` reads as absent or as a proxy.
  Live validation answered "absent", so the probe is spent and `plan=` — the decision taken, which is what
  support reads back — stays alone, with the answer moved into the comment beside the flag.

### Round-7 live validation (2026-07-29) — the relocation works; the old directory survives it

On build `0.1.7.20260729-0912`, re-parenting a fresh subsystem no longer reports a false
`EDT_TRANSACTION_FAILED`: the root entry is dropped, the `.mdo` moves to
`src/Subsystems/WaveParent/Subsystems/WaveR6Child/`, the object stays addressable by its flat FQN
(`exists:true`, `parentSubsystem` set), and the parent's down-link resolves with the owner chain —
`subsystems = [… , Subsystem.WaveParent.Subsystem.WaveR6Child]` — exactly as the reference project does. The
unaddressability regression is closed.

One gap, measured rather than predicted, and it is the same one named as the only thing left to add: the OLD
top-level directory survives the move, leaving a duplicate 206-byte `.mdo` that a workspace refresh would
re-import as a second subsystem. Filesystem reconciliation after a successful relocation is **outstanding** —
`relocateSubsystemStorage` already holds both FQNs and `MetadataResourcePaths.subsystemDirectory` computes both
paths; the removal has to run after the export, guarded by "the new `.mdo` exists", or it would delete the only
copy. The round-7 addendum in `issues/2026-07-28-bus-drain-recon.md` carries the insertion point.

Pre-existing corruption is not repairable through the tool and should not be: `Subsystem.WaveChild` in the
sandbox stays unaddressable and is left as the defect reference.

### Round-7 (2026-07-29) — the fourth side of subsystem nesting: the storage itself

* **Re-parenting a subsystem now moves its storage, so the object stays addressable.** `ce4bf06` added the
  third side of the nesting — `Configuration.subsystems` lists the roots only — but dropped the root entry
  without moving the child's top object, which made the previous behaviour *worse* than the duplicate it
  removed. Live on the sandbox: `update_metadata set.parentSubsystem = Subsystem.WaveParent` on
  `Subsystem.WaveChild` wrote all three files correctly and then failed with
  `[EDT_TRANSACTION_FAILED] Metadata object not found after commit`, because the child's `.mdo` still sat at
  `src/Subsystems/WaveChild/`. The reason, decompiled from EDT 2025.2.3: a subsystem's BM FQN is its OWNER
  CHAIN — `MdTopObjectFqnGeneratorDelegate` registers a root one as `Subsystem.<Name>` and a nested one as
  `<ownerFqn>.Subsystem.<Name>` — and `QualifiedNameFilePathConverter.handleCommonResource` turns that chain
  into `src/Subsystems/<A>/Subsystems/<B>/<B>.mdo`. A parent's `.mdo` refers to its children by BARE NAME,
  resolved against that chain, so a child left under the flat FQN turns the parent's own down-link into a
  nameless stub: nothing name-based can match it, and no tool can address the object any more. The fix mirrors
  EDT's own `MdRefactoringService.SubsystemMoveOperation` — detach from the old owner, `updateTopObjectFqn`
  into the new owner's slot, then join its list — which EDT itself routes through `initiateRename` with an
  unchanged name, a move being an FQN rename and nothing else. The root entry is surrendered only *against* a
  successful relocation and restored when there is none: a double registration is cosmetically wrong, no
  registration that resolves is a lost object. The relocated FQN is also what the export batch now targets,
  and one unresolvable target no longer sinks the whole batch — after a relocation the old FQN IS
  unresolvable, and the per-target retry is what keeps the co-edited parent reaching disk. New pure
  `SubsystemTree.qualifiedName`/`nameChain` carry the FQN rule; the "flat at any depth" claim the old javadoc
  and one test repeated is corrected — flat is an alias our tree walk supports, not the storage FQN.

* **Deleting a subsystem now sweeps and exports every parent, and deletes the right directory.** Two breaks
  independent of the above, both reachable on a correctly nested subsystem. `removeSubsystemLinks` matched
  parents' entries by `getName()`, which reads back `null` on an unresolved proxy — exactly the entries that
  need sweeping — so it now compares `SubsystemIdentity`. And the parents it edits are separate top objects
  that were in no export target at all (the only target was the object that had just ceased to exist), so
  `delete_metadata` gains the same co-edited-FQN collection `update_metadata`/`create_metadata` have. The
  filesystem cleanup derived `src/Subsystems/<Name>` from the request's flat FQN, which for a nested subsystem
  names a top-level sibling that does not exist — the real directory survived the delete and would be
  re-imported as a resurrected subsystem; the storage FQN is now captured before the unlink and drives the
  path through the new `MetadataResourcePaths.subsystemDirectory`. 21 new behavioural tests on the pure FQN and
  path rules, plus 5 wiring assertions. Live validation pending.

### Round-6 (2026-07-29) — live validation of round 5, and the hole the guard's own javadoc named

* **The unknown-parameter advisory now covers every registered tool, not just the ones that inherit it.**
  `8ed8c67` added the note to `AbstractTool.execute`, and its javadoc cites `get_diagnostics` answering a
  `project=…` call about the default project "without a word" as one of the three live cases that motivated
  it. `get_diagnostics` and `get_diagnostics_details` are the only two tools that `implement ITool` directly,
  so neither ever received the note the commit was written for. Measured live on build
  `0.1.7.20260729-0811`: `get_diagnostics(project="TestConfiguration", scope=project)` returned 6402 errors
  belonging to **`/Accounting management`** — the accepted spelling is `project_name`, the key was dropped,
  `resolveDefaultProjectName()` picked another project, and nothing in the answer said so. Every other tool
  called in the same session did emit its note. The advisory moves out of `AbstractTool`'s private methods
  into a shared `ToolAdvisory`, and `ToolRegistry.register`/`registerDynamicTool` wrap any non-`AbstractTool`
  in `AdvisoryToolWrapper` — coverage becomes a property of *registration* rather than of a superclass, so a
  future tool cannot opt out by picking a different base. Nothing in the UI bundle changes, which matters
  because that bundle has no test runtime. The wrapper delegates all seven `ITool` defaults on purpose: one
  that answered them itself would quietly strip a destructive tool of its confirmation prompt, and a test
  pins that. 8 behavioural tests.

### Round-5 (2026-07-29) — the parameter round-trip, answered by a zero-build probe

* **`dcs_manage create_main_schema` can now repair the state it gets reported in.** The persistence fix
  (`7b175ca`) left an idempotency guard that answered "already done" whenever a template typed
  `DataCompositionSchema` existed under the requested name — without checking that its `template` reference
  resolves to anything. That dangling shape is exactly the wreckage the original bug leaves behind: the
  `<templates>` entry sits in `Report.mdo` and `Templates/X/Template.dcs` does not exist. Since the default
  name is always `MainDataCompositionSchema`, every affected user's *second* call hit the guard and got a
  no-op, after which the on-disk probe honestly reported the file missing forever — the only escape was
  `force_replace=true`, which also wipes content. A no-op now requires a schema that actually resolves.
  Second defect from the same commit: `resetSchemaContent` ran on every reuse of a pre-existing top-object,
  including calls that never asked for `force_replace` — replace wipes, repair preserves. Also
  `schemaRebound` now counts as a mutation, without which the force-export was skipped for a repair on a
  `DataProcessor` owner. The whole create/reuse/repair/refuse decision moves into a pure `MutationPlan`
  (no EDT types), 18 new behavioural tests including two exhaustive sweeps of all 48 input combinations for
  the invariants the defect broke. The fix rests on one live-unverified assumption — that a dangling
  `BasicTemplate.template` reads back as absent rather than as an unresolved proxy — so the log line carries
  `plan=` and `sameNameSchemaBound=` for a single diagnostic round to settle it.

* **`get_diagnostics`'s origin rules became testable.** The review-marker exclusion itself shipped earlier
  (`fc9861f`), but the filter and the counters lived as private methods of the UI bundle's collector, which no
  test runtime in this build can reach (`com.codepilot1c.ui.tests` is a pom with no sources, no MANIFEST, and
  is not in the reactor) — so they were pinned by grepping the source, the anti-pattern that let two other
  assertions rot unnoticed this same round. Both rules move into a pure `DiagnosticOriginSelection` in
  `core/diagnostics`; the collector delegates and holds no copy. 15 behavioural tests, including the case a
  "filter early, count what is left" fix would miss: with `origin=all` review overlays come back into the
  answer and must still stay out of the counters. The `origin` schema description is trimmed to
  input-decision guidance per the tool-description convention.

* **Nesting a subsystem takes it off the configuration root, and un-nesting puts it back.** F1 fixed two
  sides of subsystem nesting; there is a third. Ground truth from Accounting management (live 2026-07-29):
  `Configuration.mdo` holds exactly 34 `<subsystems>Subsystem.X</subsystems>` entries — one per top-level
  subsystem — and no nested one (`AccessManagement`, `Calendar`, `Bonuses` are all absent, their root
  `StandardSubsystems` present). The sandbox instead listed `Subsystem.WaveChild` both under `WaveParent`
  **and** at the root, because nothing ever removed it: `reparentSubsystem` wrote the two subsystem-side
  references and left `Configuration.subsystems` alone. The membership is now settled in both directions —
  which also matters on detach, since a subsystem dropped from its parent and absent from the root would
  leave the configuration altogether. Asymmetric on the same grounds as `SubsystemIdentity`: an entry that
  cannot be identified is left alone rather than removed, and a subsystem that cannot be identified is not
  added (a blind add would append a second root entry instead of matching the one already there).

* **Deleting a subsystem no longer leaves a dangling entry in its parent.** `removeTopLevelObjectLinks` swept
  only `Configuration.subsystems`, so deleting a subsystem EDT itself had nested left
  `<subsystems>Name</subsystems>` behind in the parent's `.mdo` — and with the root fix above that would now
  apply to the ones this plugin nests too. Every parent that lists the name is swept as well.

* Two assertions of `SubsystemNestingSymmetryContractTest` had fallen behind the code in round 4 (the file
  was outside that round's test filter, so its failure went unseen): one pinned a `return false;` that
  `addSubsystemChild` no longer has, the other the name comparison `sameSubsystem` gave up when identity
  moved into `SubsystemIdentity`. Both now describe the current code, and the identity internals are left to
  `SubsystemIdentityTest`, which tests them by result. A reminder of why source-contract assertions are
  only ever a supplement.

* **A rendered parameter cell survives the round-trip.** `render_template` wrote
  `[["Товар","Цена"],["[Название]","[Сумма]"]]` and `inspect_template` read the second row back as two
  **empty** cells, while parameters in real EDT-authored templates read fine. Direction was undetermined at
  the round-4 handoff; one probe settled it without a build — the rendered `Template.mxlx` held
  `<c><f>0</f></c>`, so nothing had been written and `inspect_template` was innocent. The reason is in
  `V8MoxelSerializer.writeCell` (2025.2.3, decompiled): the branch is chosen by **format**, not by content —
  `<parameter>` is written only when `formats[cell.getFormatIndex()]` carries `fillType=Parameter`, else the
  cell's text is written, and a parameter cell has none. Every format `render_template` produced was plain, so
  each parameter cell serialized to nothing while the tool reported success. The format table now carries a
  parameter flavour of every style and a parameter cell points at it; `detailParameter` needs none of this
  (the serializer writes it unconditionally). An empty binding (`[]`, `[ ]`) is treated as text rather than a
  parameter, because the serializer skips an empty parameter name and would leave exactly the same silent
  hole. New `TemplateCellRendering`, free of EDT types so the pairing the serializer depends on is held by a
  test rather than by reading the source. 12 tests.

### Round-4 (2026-07-29) — F1 root-caused off its own diagnostic, template artifacts renamed

The diagnostic build shipped in `c24ccd7` answered on the first live call, so the F1 fix rests on an
observation rather than on a guess. Re-running `update_metadata set.parentSubsystem` printed, per entry of
`WaveParent.subsystems`:

```
parent=WaveParent child=WaveChild childProxy=false childBmFqn=Subsystem.WaveChild
existing=[class=Subsystem impl=SubsystemImpl proxy=true name=null bmFqn=transient
          uri=bm://TestConfiguration/Subsystem.WaveParent.Subsystem.WaveChild#/ | ...]
```

* **A repeated `set.parentSubsystem` no longer duplicates the child in the parent's `.mdo`, and clears the
  duplicates it already wrote.** The entries of a parent's `subsystems` collection are unresolved EMF proxies:
  no name, no usable BM FQN, identity only in the URI — so the name-only membership test could never match one
  and every repeat appended another `<subsystems>` line. Identity now falls back to the URI when no name is
  readable, and the reading is deliberately strict: the last slash segment must be a dotted chain whose
  penultimate element is literally `Subsystem`. A shape that does not match yields **no** identity rather than
  a guessed one, because a missed match merely reproduces the old duplicate while a wrong match would silently
  drop somebody's real child. On the same grounds `addSubsystemChild` now prunes repeat occurrences of the same
  child (a subsystem listed twice under one parent is invalid anyway) and leaves unidentifiable entries strictly
  alone. New `SubsystemIdentity`, free of EMF types so the rule is tested by result; the diagnostic logging it
  replaces is removed as its javadoc asked. 19 tests.

* **Template artifacts are written and read under the name EDT actually uses.** Every path was hard-coded to
  `Template.mxl`, which EDT uses for no template type at all. Live against the real Accounting management
  configuration (680 template artifacts): 270 spreadsheets are stored as `Template.mxlx` and **zero** as
  `Template.mxl`, and the format is XML (`<document xmlns="http://v8.1c.ru/8.2/data/spreadsheet">`), not the
  binary MOXCEL this plugin wrote. `inspect_template` on a real template answered `(файл не найден)` — the read
  path missed every template a real project has. The mapping is not inferred from that survey: it is EDT's own,
  read out of the constant pool of `com._1c.g5.v8.dt.ide.QualifiedNameFilePathConverter` (2025.2.3), and covers
  all ten `TemplateType` constants — `mxlx`, `txt`, `bin`, `htmldoc`, `axdt`, `scheme`, `geos`, `dcs`, `dcsat`,
  `addin`. Serialization moves to `MoxelResourceMxlx` (an `AbstractXmlResource`) for both `render_template` and
  the empty artifact `add_metadata_child` creates; reads try the correct name first and a legacy `Template.mxl`
  second, so projects that already received one still resolve. An unknown template type yields no extension
  instead of a default, and the types this service cannot serialize now leave the artifact **absent** with an
  honest log rather than receiving a spreadsheet blob under a foreign extension — the raw-MOXCEL fallback is
  gone for the same reason. New `TemplateArtifactPath` (pure, no EDT types), 9 tests; `Import-Package` gains
  `com._1c.g5.modeling.xml[.serializer]`, which `MoxelResourceMxlx` needs.

* **An empty spreadsheet artifact serializes instead of failing.** Live validation of the above produced the
  right file name and a **0-byte** body, with `createEmptySpreadsheetArtifact failed: index=0, size=0`. One
  probe narrowed it: `render_template` wrote a valid 1758-byte XML to the same template and
  `inspect_template` read it back, so only the *empty* document failed — and the reason sits a few lines away,
  where `renderTemplate` adds a default `Format` that the empty artifact never got. The serializer indexes
  `formats[0]` unconditionally. The empty document now carries one format, and a zero-length leftover (the
  resource opens the file before it can fail) is cleared rather than left to read back as a 0-byte template.
  The same path failed on the previous build too — a valid spreadsheet artifact had never been produced, only
  silently.

* **A composite tool no longer swallows a key belonging to a different command.** `dcs_manage`,
  `external_manage` and `extension_manage` declare the *union* of every command's parameters, so both layers of
  `8ed8c67` waved through `dataset_name` sent with `command:"upsert_param"`: the schema declares the key, so it
  counted as known, and nobody read it. The per-command contract is **extracted from the schema** rather than
  restated: each property's description already begins with its owning command (`(upsert_dataset) Dataset
  name`, `(upsert_param/upsert_field) Expression`), which held for all three tools when checked key-by-key
  against their `doExecute`. An untagged key, a prose tag (`(mutating commands)`), or a tag matching no command
  is treated as shared, so tag drift cannot produce a false refusal. `edt_validate_request` refuses a foreign
  key before issuing the token (naming the key, its owning command, the requested command and the keys that
  command accepts); `AbstractTool` appends an advisory for the read-only path. New `CompositeCommandKeyGuard`,
  45 tests, including nine that replay a full legitimate payload per mutating command so the guard cannot
  regress a working call.

### Round-3 live probes (2026-07-29) — one round-2 claim withdrawn, wave 3 started

Two calls on the sandbox settled the "composite types are still collapsed on the CREATE path" claim from the
round-2 section below: it is **withdrawn**. `add_metadata_child` with `properties.type:["String","Boolean"]`
writes two `<types>` on the create path exactly as it does through `update_metadata`; the failing round-2
repro had passed `type` as a **top-level** parameter instead, and the `String(150)` it produced was the
default-type branch plus the string-length fallback, not a lost list. Nothing needs fixing between
`normalizeTypeSpecList` and `setAttributeType` (commit `04e34e6`).

What the probe did expose is worse: `edt_validate_request` accepted the payload carrying an unknown
top-level key, **dropped the key**, answered `valid:true` and issued a token — so a mistyped parameter
wrote wrong metadata to disk and reported success. Third live instance of the swallowed-parameter class
(after `scan_metadata_index kinds` and `get_diagnostics project`), and the first that mutates. **Closed
below.**

* **`edt_validate_request` now refuses a payload whose top-level keys the target tool does not accept,
  instead of dropping them and issuing a token anyway.** The accepted set is the target mutating tool's own
  `getParameterSchema()` (single source — it cannot drift from what the tool really takes), plus the extra
  spellings `MetadataRequestValidationService` genuinely reads (`adoptExisting`/`adopt`, the
  `ensure_module_artifact` camelCase aliases, `role_fqn`/`role_name`) — a key that IS read is not silently
  discarded, so it must not be refused. The refusal names the probable intent: a case/underscore variant, a
  singular-plural variant, a short-edit-distance typo, or the nested container the key is documented to live
  in (`type` → `properties.type`, which is the exact live case). **Top level only** — `properties`, `changes`
  and the operation descriptors are legitimately open-ended and are never judged. Fail-open by construction:
  an unparsable schema, a schema without `properties`, or an explicit `additionalProperties: true` (how the
  dispatchers declare that they route keys they do not list) yields a clean verdict, so no legitimate call can
  be falsely refused. All 21 operations of the advertised `operation` enum were audited against their target
  tool's schema — including the three composite routers, which all enumerate their per-command keys — so the
  exemption list ships **empty**. New `SchemaKeyGuard` (pure key-matching/did-you-mean, no EDT runtime) and
  `ValidationPayloadKeyContract` (operation → target tool + audited aliases). Covered behaviourally by
  `SchemaKeyGuardTest` (23), `EdtValidateRequestUnknownPayloadKeyTest` (13, incl. the live case and
  "the same call with `type` inside `properties` still validates") and `ValidationPayloadKeyContractAuditTest`
  (5, the audit encoded as a drift alarm).

* **Every tool now says so when it ignores an unknown parameter.** `AbstractTool.execute` compares the
  incoming top-level keys against the tool's schema and appends one honest advisory line naming the ignored
  key(s) and the likely intended one. This is the layer that covers the read-only tools where the same class
  was observed live (`scan_metadata_index` answered a `kinds=…` call with everything unfiltered;
  `get_diagnostics` answered a `project=…` call about the default project). **Advisory only** — it never
  fails a call, never re-routes one, and preserves the result's type and structured data, so a tool whose
  schema under-declares a pass-through key cannot regress. Dispatch-only delegates (`edt_update_infobase`,
  `qa_status`, …) are exempt because their dispatcher forwards `command` and both project aliases to them.
  Covered by `AbstractToolUnknownParameterAdvisoryTest` (7).

**F1 non-idempotency reproduced** on this build (a repeated `set.parentSubsystem` duplicates the parent's
entry) and its root confirmed by observation, not inference: every entry of the parent's `subsystems`
collection reads back nameless, so the name-based identity test can never match. What those entries are is
not yet established, so this build ships **diagnostics** on that path and the identity fix follows from
their output rather than from a guess.

* **`create_form` no longer fails a fully successful materialization.** `resolveOwnerMdoWorkspacePath` had
  two branches and only the external one filtered its result; the base-configuration branch returned the raw
  project-relative conversion, which for a top object is the FQN-shaped string `Catalog.Catalog`. Non-null
  suppressed the correct `src/<folder>/<name>/<name>.mdo` fallback, so the wait polled a file that can never
  exist and raised `FORM_MATERIALIZATION_TIMEOUT` **after** the form was written correctly — a false negative
  the caller can only read as "retry or roll back", and the wait path is mandatory so no parameter routed
  around it. The filter now lives in one place (`MetadataResourcePaths.asOwnerMdoPath`) used by both
  branches, so the asymmetry cannot come back. Covered by `MetadataResourcePathsTest` (8 cases, behavioural).
* **`template_type` stopped being silently ignored or silently downgraded.** The key was read case-exactly,
  so `properties.templateType` was dropped, and an unrecognized value fell through to the spreadsheet
  default — which is how asking for `dcs` produced a 13-byte `Template.mxl`. The key is now alias-tolerant
  and an unknown value fails loud naming every accepted value.
* **Inline qualifiers survive a map carrier.** `parseInlineTypeSpec` only looked at the outer value, so
  `{type:"String(100)"}` lost its length. This bit composite requests hardest: the splitter turns every
  element of `["String(100)","Boolean"]` into its own `{type:<element>}` carrier, so each element's inline
  qualifier was dropped and a separate `length` sibling was needed to keep it. The inline spec is now parsed
  from the type carrier as well.

Latent and **not** fixed, kept as a separate issue: EDT's own `TEMPLATE_EXTENSIONS` maps a spreadsheet
template to `mxlx` while `ensureTemplateArtifact` writes `.mxl`. The sandbox contains no spreadsheet
templates at all, so there is no ground truth here to settle it against — parked rather than guessed.

### Round-2 live validation of build `0.1.7.20260729-0028` — two entries above are overstated

Validated on a real EDT after installing the wave. **Confirmed working:** `ExchangePlan.content` in both
shapes, with an unresolvable entry refused loudly (a missing `<autoRecord>` element on disk is EMF omitting
the EClass default, i.e. `Deny` — the explicit `Allow` is what gets written); `thisNode` refused with the
honest not-plugin-managed reason; the dotted-subsystem-FQN refusal now naming the flat form; the DCS
`templateSource=caller|default` distinction visible in the log with an identical effective name; and
composite `type` written whole **through `update_metadata`** — `["String(100)", "Boolean"]` produced two
`<types>` with `<length>100</length>`.

Two claims made above do not hold, and are corrected here rather than left standing:

* **Composite types are still collapsed on the `add_metadata_child` CREATE path.** `type: ["String",
  "Boolean"]` writes a single `<types>String</types>` with the default `<length>150</length>`. Narrowed by
  live probing: the requested type does arrive (no `Auto-assign default type` line is logged, so
  `requestedType` was non-null and the default branch never ran), and the shared builder is proven correct
  by the `update_metadata` result above — so the list is lost between `normalizeTypeSpecList(properties)`
  and `setAttributeType` on that path. The `150` is separately explained by the map-carrier gap already
  documented above: an inline `String(100)` is parsed only when the carrier is itself a string. Needs a
  behavioural test on the splitter with the exact create-path shape (`{name, type: [...]}`), not another
  source-contract assertion.
* **Two-sided subsystem nesting is not idempotent.** Two identical `set.parentSubsystem` calls leave
  `<subsystems>WaveChild2</subsystems>` twice in the parent. Root cause observed, not guessed: reading the
  parent live renders its collection as `subsystems | [Subsystem, Subsystem]` — the EClass name, which is
  the inspector's fallback when the `name` feature is empty. The stored entries are unresolved references
  with no readable name, so the name-based identity the fix relies on can never match them and every call
  appends. Identity for that collection must not go through `getName()`.

Also corrected: the F2 note claimed the marker/name pair alias resolves on a properly two-sided tree. Live,
with the parent listing the child on disk, `Subsystem.<Parent>.Subsystem.<Child>` still answers
`METADATA_NOT_FOUND`. The flat form remains the only address that resolves — which is what the tool schemas
say, and they were right before being softened on that claim.

**Method note for the next round:** all three of these shipped with green source-contract tests. Those
assert that text is present in the source, so they cannot see behaviour, and they passed while the feature
did not work. Where the logic is pure, test the result (as `TypeValueSplitterTest` does); where it is not,
validate live before claiming it works.

### Subsystem nesting is written on both sides (2026-07-29) — F1

Live check on an EDT-authored configuration (132 `.mdo`: 98 with `<parentSubsystem>`, 22 with
`<subsystems>`) settled how EDT actually stores nesting: **twice**. The parent lists
`<subsystems>WaveChild</subsystems>` by **bare name**; the child carries
`<parentSubsystem>Subsystem.WaveParent</parentSubsystem>` as a **flat FQN**. They are two independent
non-containment references with no `EOpposite`, so EMF maintains neither copy — and `update_metadata`
`set.parentSubsystem` wrote only the child side. The result was a **half-linked** tree: the parent could
not see its child, while the metadata tree, the command interface and our own
`Subsystem.Parent.Subsystem.Child` nested alias all read the parent side.

Both slots now write both sides. Setting `parentSubsystem` adds the child to the new parent's
`subsystems` and drops it from the previous parent's; setting `subsystems` points every listed child at
the parent and clears the pointer of every child dropped from the list; unsetting either slot clears
both. Idempotent by construction — membership is tested before adding, the pointer is only rewritten when
it differs, and an unchanged list is not cleared and rebuilt — so a re-run neither duplicates an entry nor
churns the `.mdo`. Re-running against an already half-linked model **repairs** it, because membership is
ensured even when the pointer already matched. Identity is the flat name, not the Java instance: a value
resolved inside the write transaction is a different handle from the one already in the list.

The far side lives in a **different** `.mdo`, so it needs its own export target and its own EOL snapshot
or nothing reaches disk. A write now reports every co-edited top object to a sink that both extends the
export batch (`forceExportTopLevelObjects`, one `forceExport` call for the whole set) and extends the EOL
guard (`EolGuard.addCoEditedFqn`, snapshotting the far side the moment it becomes known — still ahead of
the export pipeline, since the mutation happens inside the BM transaction). `create_metadata` with a
`parentSubsystem` property is wired the same way.

Left as-is and worth knowing: writing `Configuration.subsystems` (target = the configuration, not a
subsystem) still goes down the generic reference path and does not clear `parentSubsystem` on the
subsystems it lists, so promoting a nested subsystem to the root that way can still leave a half-link.
Pre-existing behaviour, not part of this fix.

### Dotted subsystem FQNs are refused with the right advice (2026-07-29) — F2

The flat form is the only subsystem address guaranteed to resolve, yet the refusal pointed at a dotted
one. `Subsystem.<Parent>.<Child>` failed
with `METADATA_PARENT_NOT_FOUND: Nested FQN segments must be marker/name pairs`, which reads as "you
forgot the marker" and sends the caller to `Subsystem.<Parent>.Subsystem.<Child>` — which fails again,
now as `METADATA_NOT_FOUND`. When the leading type token is a subsystem, the message now names the
**flat** form as the only canonical address (`Subsystem.<Name>` at any depth, because both subsystem
collections are non-containment and every nested subsystem is its own top object) and says to drop the
parent segments rather than add a marker. The general marker/name-pair rule is unchanged for every kind
that owns containment children. The text lives in one pure helper
(`SubsystemTree.nestedFqnRejectionMessage`) shared by the configuration walker and the external-object
walker, and agrees with the wording already in `update_metadata`, `add_metadata_child` and
`edt_metadata_details`.

Note on the second failure: the nested alias is not itself broken — it walks `getSubsystems()`, which was
empty precisely because of F1. On an EDT-authored model it resolves; on a model our own writes had built
it could not.

### `ExchangePlan.content` is writable (2026-07-29) — B2

The registration list of an exchange plan could not be written by any tool. `content` is a containment
reference whose entries are `ExchangePlanContentItem`s — a flat EClass that is neither an `MdObject` nor
named — so every generic child shape missed it: `findNestedChild` skips non-`MdObject` values and matches
on `getName()`, `buildChildOpsFromContainmentSet` requires a `name` per entry and yields no ops without
one, and the containment arm of the reference writer then refused the write outright.

`set.content` now builds one item per requested entry, in either shape:
`content:["Catalog.Foo","Document.Bar"]` (bare FQNs) or
`content:[{mdObject:"Catalog.Foo", autoRecord:"Deny"}]` (`object` and `fqn` are accepted aliases,
`auto_record` too). `autoRecord` defaults to **`Allow`** — the platform default for a new content line —
and an unrecognised value fails loud with the valid literals instead of silently registering everything.
The object slot resolves through the shared reference resolver, which brings FQN resolution, the
compatibility check and the loud `METADATA_NOT_FOUND` along for free, so an unresolvable entry can never
be dropped while the write reports success; resolution runs against
`ExchangePlanContentItem.mdObject`, not against the owning `content` reference, whose own type would
reject every legitimate `Catalog`.

### Exotic `EDataType`s are writable; `thisNode` is refused honestly (2026-07-29) — B3

`convertAttributeValue` knew String / Integer / Long / Double / Float / Boolean / enum and then threw
"Unsupported value type", so **every** exotic model data type was unwritable — `Uuid`, and with it
`QName`, `Shortcut`, `Version`. Each of those is an `EDataType` whose own `EFactory` parses its literal
(`McoreFactoryImpl` declares `createUuidFromString`), so conversion now ends with a generic
`EcoreUtil.createFromString` fallback. This **narrows** the unsupported surface; a data type that cannot
parse its literal is still refused with the same message.

`ExchangePlan.thisNode` is the one field that must stay unwritable, and it is now refused for the right
reason: it is the identity of the plan's own node (`ЭтотУзел`), assigned by EDT on first load, and
overwriting it against a live infobase re-identifies the local node for every peer. It joins `uuid` in an
explicit deny-list at the top of the write path, with a message that says exactly that instead of the old,
misleading "Unsupported value type". **Order is the point:** the deny-list is consulted before conversion,
because the new fallback resolves a `Uuid` literal perfectly well and a guard placed after it would have
quietly made `thisNode` writable. `unset` is denied too — dropping the identity is the same damage as
overwriting it.

### Composite `type.types` is written whole (2026-07-28) — BF-12936 case 1

Asking for a composite type wrote only the first one, with no error anywhere. Three call sites shared one
root: the request normalizer collapsed a list to its first element, and the writer then built a **fresh
single-element** `TypeDescription` and assigned it, replacing any multi-type already there. The same
collapse happened during pre-resolution, so even the type-name pre-pass saw one name. Fixed together —
`update_metadata` on any `BasicFeature` (every register's Dimension, Resource, Attribute), the
`add_metadata_child` create path, and form attributes/parameters/columns — because fixing one would just
move the bug. The form path additionally validated the whole list recursively while applying one element;
now it applies all of them.

The split of raw input into one carrier per requested type moved into a pure, EDT-free `TypeValueSplitter`,
and the assembly into one `buildTypeDescription` that **fails loud on any element it cannot resolve**
rather than skipping it — a silent drop is what this whole entry is about. Each element keeps its own
qualifiers (`String(100)` next to a `CatalogRef`), with outer qualifiers inherited and per-element ones
winning. Every element resolves against the pre-mutation state and the description is assigned once, so a
composite applies atomically. No new tool parameters: the `type` shapes already accepted a list.

The single-type path had to stay behaviourally identical — it is the hot path of nearly every metadata
mutation — so the splitter returns the caller's own object (asserted by identity, maps are not copied) and
branches to synthetic carriers only when more than one type is actually requested; the qualifier blocks
were transplanted line for line, defaults included, and the error texts are unchanged. One intended
delta: a one-element list now yields the element, so an inline qualifier in `["String(100)"]` survives —
without it a list of one would lose what a list of two keeps.

`DefinedType` (and `commandParameterType`) travel a different path that `f184637` had already made
multi-type, and the recon expected it to merely lose qualifiers. It was worse: that path built its type
from a bare query string extracted by a reader that only understands `fqn`/`target_fqn`, so an element
like `{type: "String", length: 100}` resolved to null and was **dropped whole**. Both the qualifiers and
that second silent drop are closed. Qualifier support there is strictly additive — the block appears only
if asked for or already present.

Known adjacent gap, pre-existing and deliberately left: a **map** carrier written as
`{type: "String(100)"}` resolves the type but loses the bracketed length (falling back to 150), because
the inline form is parsed only when the carrier is itself a string. Composites are unaffected (their
carriers are raw strings); changing it would alter the single-carrier path this change was careful to
freeze.

### update_infobase: post-update equality is no longer opt-in (2026-07-28)

The sibling/equality work below made `equality_state` available in the update result, but only behind
`skip_if_current=true` (default false) — and the caller who does not know that flag is exactly the caller
who reads `updated: true` as "the infobase now matches" and then runs tests against stale code. The
result now always carries `equality_state_after`, read after the apply with the same in-memory EDT query
as the pre-check (no DESIGNER spawned, advisory only: an unreadable state omits the field rather than
inventing a verdict). `equality_state` keeps its old meaning — the opt-in PRE-check — so nothing that
already parses it changes. When the apply reported success yet the state is still `NOT_EQUAL`, the payload
names the documented non-convergence mode and says outright that re-running the same update will not
converge, instead of leaving the caller to issue a second call and guess. The dynamic-only case stays
quiet here because `dynamic_only_forward_warning` already carries the richer explanation.

### Live validation of the 2026-07-28 wave on build `0.1.7.20260728-1704`

Validated against a real EDT (sandbox workspace, `plugin_version` confirmed through the beacon), not only
unit tests. Confirmed live: the DCS main schema reaches disk (`match=true`, `attached=true`,
`dataSourceSeeded=true`, `Template.dcs` present with a seeded `<dataSource>`); `runtime_used` with
`candidates_tried` on `dry_run` and `reject_reasons` plus a loud `runtime_not_resolved` on an unmatchable
version; zero executed tests yield `status=no_tests_matched` with a `reason` (`infobase_stale` takes
precedence over `filter_matched_nothing`, with the filter echoed back) instead of a green verdict; red
tests return on the success channel as `status=tests_failed`; `equality_state` and `preflight_warnings`
ride along in the run result; a foreign `1cv8c` was **spared** with an explicit warning naming its PID,
proving the three-way orphan-kill guard (thin client **and** `RunUnitTests=` marker **and** infobase
match) holds in the presence of other stands' clients; the shared-infobase fan-out fields on the read
path; `edt_metadata_details` resolving a `Subsystem` (no more false `exists:false`); and `adopt_existing`
refusing to hijack an already-registered object.

Two findings the wave did not deliver, corrected here rather than left in the changelog as done:

* **Nested subsystem addressing.** The flat canonical form works, but no dotted form resolves at all —
  neither `Subsystem.<Parent>.<Child>` (`METADATA_PARENT_NOT_FOUND`) nor the marker/name pair
  `Subsystem.<Parent>.Subsystem.<Child>` (`METADATA_NOT_FOUND`). The tolerant alias the recon planned is
  not in the build, so the schema texts for `update_metadata`, `add_metadata_child` and
  `edt_metadata_details` document the flat form as the only one and tell the caller not to build a nested
  one. The `must be marker/name pairs` message is actively misleading for subsystems — it points at a form
  that also fails.
* **`edt_metadata_details` answered a nested FQN with the wrong object.** It read the leading
  `<Type>.<Name>` pair out of a longer dotted FQN and returned whatever that resolved to, so
  `Subsystem.<Parent>.<Child>` came back carrying the **parent's** properties under the requested path —
  a silent wrong answer, strictly worse than the `exists:false` this same method was fixed to stop
  emitting. A longer FQN is now a miss with a message that names the supported form (flat for subsystems,
  child objects out of scope) instead of a confident lie.
* **Half-linked nesting.** `set.parentSubsystem` writes only the child side. EDT itself writes nesting on
  both: `<subsystems><Child></subsystems>` (bare name) on the parent and
  `<parentSubsystem>Subsystem.<Parent></parentSubsystem>` on the child, so after our call the parent does
  not list the child.

Not reproducible locally, delegated to the stacks that hold the fixtures: the `qa_run` BDD suite (no
`qa-config.json`/`.feature` in the sandbox clone) and the `adopt_existing` orphan path (the two-index
desync cannot be synthesised). **Correction (2026-08-10, Round-15): the orphan path claim was wrong — the
desync IS synthesisable on the sandbox and the path is now live-validated there. The recipe follows from
the index-B rule stated two paragraphs above. Only the `qa_run` BDD fixture gap still stands.** Also recorded: in auto mode `candidates_tried` lists only the installations
actually tried, so "rejected" and "never enumerated" stay indistinguishable — on this box `8.5.1.1302` is
installed, auto picked `8.3.27.2074` and tried nothing else, while an explicit `runtime_version=8.5.1`
resolves it, which points the pre-release autoselect reports at a project pin or EDT's preferred runtime
rather than at the resolver preferring the newest install.

### create_metadata adopt_existing (2026-07-28) — BF-13405: exists:false and "FQN already in use" for the same object

There are two independent metadata indexes. **A** is the configuration composition: the flat typed lists
in `Configuration.mdo`, which in EMF are non-containment `refers X[]` references on `Configuration`.
**B** is the BM top-object FQN registry: every `.mdo` on disk is imported as its own top object and its
FQN registered in the namespace regardless of whether `Configuration.mdo` ever mentioned it.
`create_metadata` consulted A (`existsTopLevel` said "absent"), then created and called `attachTopObject`,
which consults B ("occupied"). Hence the reported pair: `edt_metadata_details` → `exists:false`,
`create_metadata` → FQN already in use, `update_infobase` → "Unknown metadata object". The BM state is
not corrupt — the object is loaded and attached; exactly one thing is missing, the entry in
`Configuration.<collection>`.

It surfaced as `EDT_TRANSACTION_FAILED` because `BmFqnAlreadyInUseException` and
`BmNameAlreadyInUseException` are siblings with **no common base class** and only the latter had a catch
arm, so the FQN clash fell into the generic `RuntimeException` handler. Both `executeWrite` and
`attachTopLevelObject` now translate it to `METADATA_ALREADY_EXISTS` with text that names the
disagreement and the cure — an honest backstop that stands on its own, independent of the verb below.

`create_metadata` now probes index B before creating (`getTopObjectByFqn`, best-effort: a probe failure
degrades to null and creation proceeds as before). On a hit, the default — `adopt_existing` unset — is a
loud, actionable refusal that changes nothing and offers both exits: adopt, or delete the `.mdo`
directory. With `adopt_existing=true` the existing top object is registered into its typed collection
and nothing else: strictly additive, one entry in one list, no `createTopLevelObject`, no re-attach, no
uuid rewrite. This is the mirror image of the `rights_manage` defect (`c990eaa`): there an object was
reachable by model reference but was not a resolvable top object; here it IS a resolvable top object but
is not reachable from the configuration. The method transfers, not the direction — do not trust one
index, probe the other before acting. Because the registration is additive to a single collection, it
also closes the "Configuration.mdo flat-list registration conflict" report (a git merge had dropped
`<roles>` entries) without the risk of a `changes.set.roles` rewrite of ~1300 entries.

Adoption never mutates the object it registers: `properties` passed together with `adopt_existing=true`
are **refused** (`INVALID_METADATA_CHANGE`, pointing at `update_metadata`) rather than silently dropped,
and a FQN held by an object of another EClass is refused too instead of blowing up in the typed cast.
The result carries the distinction: a new `CreateMetadataOutcome` adds `adopted: true|false` and
`registered_into: Configuration.<collection>` to the tool output, leaving the shared
`MetadataOperationResult` that other tools consume untouched.

Contract changes: new optional `adopt_existing` (alias `adopt`), default false; it must be passed in the
`edt_validate_request` payload too — the token payload is authoritative for every field of a mutation, so
a token issued without the flag is refused with `INVALID_VALIDATION_TOKEN` rather than quietly downgraded,
and `edt_validate_request` now always echoes `adopt_existing` in its normalized payload. `create_metadata`
output gains two lines. An FQN clash that used to read `EDT_TRANSACTION_FAILED` now reads
`METADATA_ALREADY_EXISTS`, so playbooks branching on that code change path.

**Caution for live validation:** `rebindTopLevelIntoConfiguration` removes the object from
`Configuration.getContent()` by name. In an EXTENSION project `<content>` is meaningful (it lists adopted
base objects), so adoption there could strip a legitimate entry. BF-13405 is a base configuration and the
same removal already ran on every create, but do not exercise adoption on a live extension first.

### Subsystem FQNs and the kind→collection map (2026-07-28) — nested subsystems were unaddressable, half the kinds reported exists:false

A subsystem's canonical EDT FQN is FLAT at every nesting depth — `Subsystem.PaymentCalendar`, never
`Subsystem.Finance.Subsystem.PaymentCalendar`. Both subsystem collections (`Configuration.subsystems`
and `Subsystem.subsystems`) are non-containment, so a nested subsystem has `eContainer() == null`, and
`MdUtil.getFullyQualifiedName` falls back to a two-segment name when `eContainingFeature()` is null;
each nested subsystem is a top object with its own `.mdo`. So the flat form the caller wrote was
canonically CORRECT and still failed: `findTopLevel` resolved SUBSYSTEM through
`configuration.getSubsystems()`, i.e. the first level only. The nested spelling failed too, in a
different place — `findNestedChild` iterates containment references, and `subsystems` is not one.

Resolution is now recursive (new pure `SubsystemTree`, generic over a node accessor so the traversal is
unit-testable without EMF, with an identity-based visited set because a non-containment link can cycle).
A name shared by two subsystems under different parents is **refused, not resolved**: a flat FQN cannot
address one of them, so the error names every colliding parent and points at the nested alias, instead of
silently returning whichever the traversal reached first. The nested chain is accepted as a tolerant
alias, deliberately narrow — only the `subsystems` feature of a `Subsystem` — because `Subsystem.content`
is also a non-containment many reference and a generic rule would turn every content member into an
addressable child.

The same fix removes a whole family of false negatives. The kind→collection mapping existed in FOUR
divergent copies, and every kind absent from a copy silently became "does not exist" for whatever read
it: `EdtMetadataInspectorService.findMdObjectByFqn` carried a nine-kind switch with
`default -> List.of()`, so `edt_metadata_details` answered `exists:false` for Subsystem, Role,
ExchangePlan, DefinedType and every register beyond information/accumulation — objects that plainly
existed. All four copies are now one `TopLevelCollections`: `forKind` (typed getters, exhaustive switch,
so a kind added to the enum is a compile error rather than a silent gap), `configurationTag` and
`indexScopeToken`. `existsTopLevel` collapses from 48 arms to one line, `scan_metadata_index` from 48
hand-written calls to a loop over `MetadataKind.values()`, and the inspector derives its kind through
`MetadataKind.fromString`, so plural and Russian type tokens work there too. The index token stays a
separate mapping on purpose: `scan_metadata_index` has always reported `chartofaccounts` (singular
"chart") and its scope-alias table keys off that spelling. The 47 non-subsystem getters, all 48
`.mdo` tags and all 47 index token→getter pairings were diffed against the previous switches to keep the
refactor byte-identical where it must be.

Contract changes: `Subsystem.<Name>` now resolves for nested subsystems in `update_metadata`,
`add_metadata_child` and `edt_metadata_details` (was `METADATA_NOT_FOUND` / `exists:false`); the nested
chain resolves too; `scan_metadata_index` now lists nested subsystems, so totals and `scope=subsystems`
grow; `edt_metadata_details` returns real data for ~39 kinds that used to report `exists:false`; and a
duplicate subsystem name — previously first-match-wins — is now a loud `METADATA_ALREADY_EXISTS`, which
can turn a call that "worked" on such a configuration into a refusal. `create_metadata kind=Subsystem`
also now refuses a name already taken by a NESTED subsystem, which is correct: it occupies the same flat
FQN in the BM namespace.

### yaxunit_run (2026-07-28) — the runtime resolution was invisible, and the version parameter had the wrong name

`resolveThinClientFile` returned a bare `File` and had two failure branches, both blind: one returned
`null` without logging a single line, the other logged a warning only into the plugin log while the
caller surfaced the generic `Thin client (1cv8c.exe) runtime component not resolved`. `launch_app` and
`update_infobase` have reported `runtime_used` since `b8ad7c7`; `yaxunit_run` reported nothing, so a
resolve-fail cost the owner four blind install rounds and the request to print the chosen version and the
paths tried stood open from 2026-07-03.

The resolution is now a record — `ThinClientResolution` with `file`, `versionWithBuild`, `location`,
`source`, `candidatesTried` and `rejectReasons` — and BOTH failure branches log the whole audit trail.
A dedicated `ThinClientNotResolvedException` carries it, so a tool can render the structure instead of a
sentence; `resolveThinClientFile` stays a null-returning delegate, so nothing existing changed shape.
`yaxunit_run` reports `runtime_used {version, location, source, requested, binary}` plus
`candidates_tried` / `reject_reasons` on every outcome — success, failure, and `dry_run`, which is the
only cheap way to ask which client would be launched without spending a 300-second run. An unresolvable
runtime is now `status="runtime_not_resolved"` with the candidates and the reason each one lost, not an
opaque string.

The version parameter was also the odd one out: `launch_app`, `update_infobase` and `connect_infobase`
all take `runtime_version`, this tool took `version_mask` — a trap for the calling model rather than a
cosmetic inconsistency. `runtime_version` is now the primary name, `version_mask` a synonym (on a
conflict `runtime_version` wins and the loser is echoed back as `ignored_version_mask`). Priority is the
same chain `launch_app` applies: explicit parameter → the project's `.launch` pin (`USE_AUTO=false`) →
project+infobase auto-resolution, so the two tools can no longer resolve to different platforms for the
same project. Reading the pin is best-effort and never fails the run.

### thin-client resolution (2026-07-28) — a client launch asked EDT as if it were an infobase update, and took a single newest-wins shot

`InfobaseAccessType` has exactly two values and every path passed `UPDATE`, including all four thin-client
launches. Decompiling `ResolvableRuntimeInstallationManager` shows the access type selects the version
compatibility filter (`filterUpdateVersionCompatible` vs `filterClientLaunchVersionCompatible`), so a
platform the EDT launch UI had selected for launching a client could be filtered out when asked for under
`UPDATE`. Client launches now ask under `CLIENT_LAUNCH`; the infobase update path keeps `UPDATE`
(`resolveInstallation` grew the parameter, the old overload still defaults to `UPDATE`, so
`update_infobase`, `import_project` and the thick/designer launch paths are untouched).

The second half was the single shot. `resolveByProjectAndInfobase` is newest-wins, and its compatibility
filter goes through `getCompatibilityModeIfStarted(IV8Project)` — an empty `Optional` on a project whose
DT model has not started, i.e. the filter silently switches off and the newest installed platform (a
pre-release) wins. Worse, one bad pick sank the whole resolution: an installation registered in
Preferences whose directory is gone resolved to a path that does not exist. The resolver now walks
candidates from `findUsefulForProjectAndInfobase(..., CLIENT_LAUNCH)` (falling back to the full registry,
then to EDT's single shot) and accepts the first whose `resolve` + `resolveExecutor` yields a `1cv8c.exe`
that is actually on disk, recording why each loser lost. A ghost registry entry now costs one line of
diagnostics instead of the run.

There is no "pre-release" flag to filter on — `RuntimeInstallation` exposes only version, build,
location, arch and isTraining — so the beta is de-selected by ordering: an explicit mask, then the
EDT-stored per-project+infobase pin (read straight from `IInfobaseAccessManager`, because EDT itself drops
the pin when the project version cannot be calculated on a cold project), then the version the infobase
is bound to, then newest. An explicit mask keeps its old semantics exactly: EDT's own
`resolveByVersionOrMask` answer remains the first candidate and only other builds of the same requested
line queue behind it, so a caller's pin is never silently substituted.

**Touches the live-validated `qa_run` arc — both spawn paths resolve the thin client here, so the BDD
suite (7/7) must be re-run live before this is relied on.** Deliberately NOT extended to `launch_app`'s
thick/designer paths: they are client launches too, but switching them would widen the re-validation
surface beyond what the diagnosis establishes. The parameter now exists, so that is a one-token change
later. The CompatibilityMode line was also left out of the preference chain on purpose — the only public
route (`IV8Project → getConfiguration() → getCompatibilityMode()`) triggers a BM configuration load
exactly on the cold-project case this fix targets.

### dcs_manage create_schema (2026-07-28) — the schema was never attached to the BM, so nothing reached disk

`DcsFactory.createDataCompositionSchema()` was assigned straight into `template.setTemplate(schema)`.
`BasicTemplate.template` is a **transient, non-containment** reference — the same flags as `Role.rights`
and `BasicForm.form` — and the schema is a SEPARATE top-object serialized into
`Templates/<name>/Template.dcs`. So the freshly created schema was an orphan: the model accepted the
write, `attachTopObject` was never called in any branch, and the tool reported success with no artifact.
Exactly scenario "b" of the `rights_manage` defect (`c990eaa`), and the repo already documented the
failure text in the `attachBootstrappedRoleDescription` javadoc.

`createMainSchema` now attaches the schema as an external top-object, in the order the FQN generator
requires: `setName` + `setTemplateType(DataCompositionSchema)` + insertion into the owner's `templates`
list FIRST, only then `generateExternalPropertyFqn(template, BASIC_TEMPLATE__TEMPLATE)` — decompiling
`MdTopObjectFqnGeneratorDelegate` shows it appends `capitalize(reference.getName())` to the owner's
qualified name and throws a bare `AssertionFailedException` when that name is null, which is what a
template outside the container chain yields. Then: BM namespace, a defensive `getTopObjectByFqn` reuse
probe, `attachTopObject`, a re-read of the attached object from the transaction, and only THAT object
written into the reference. The generation call is wrapped so the failure surfaces as an actionable
message instead of a multi-line assertion dump.

Four defects of the same tool that would each have produced a second round are fixed with it.
**No force-export:** every `EdtMetadataService` mutator follows its transaction with `forceExport` plus a
derived-data flush; the DCS path did nothing, and since the schema is its own file, exporting only the
owner writes `Report.mdo` and leaves the schema unwritten — so `create_schema` and all three upserts now
export the owner AND the schema FQN in one batch (new `DcsExportSupport`, a deliberate copy of the
metadata-service plumbing rather than a hoist that would touch ~30 hot call sites).
**No EOL guard:** the path rewrites `Report.mdo`, which the BM serializer emits as CRLF regardless of the
file's convention; all four mutators now snapshot and restore per-file EOL, with `dcs` added to the
managed extensions. **Duplicate `<templates>`:** the old code checked "does a schema exist", never "is
the NAME taken", so `force_replace` only ever appended — the requested name is now matched
case-insensitively and `force_replace` REPLACES (reuses the template, resets the schema content).
**Empty schema:** `createDataCompositionSchema()` produces no `dataSource`, while every real `.dcs`
carries `<dataSource><name>DataSource1</name><dataSourceType>Local</dataSourceType></dataSource>`
(`dataSourceType` is a plain string, not an enum) — one is now seeded.

The result no longer claims success blind: it reports `schemaFqn`, `schemaExternalFqn`, the expected
`src/<Folder>/<Owner>/Templates/<Name>/Template.dcs`, whether that file actually exists, and a warning
when it does not. A schema present in the model but missing on disk — the reported state — triggers a
repair export and a re-probe rather than another artifact-free success. `[dcs]` diagnostics log the
generated external FQN against its expected shape, the `getTopObjectByFqn` verdict, the export target
list and the file probe, so a single install round confirms or refutes the fix by itself.

Contract change: `force_replace=true` now replaces instead of adding, and with no same-name template it
rebinds the owner's existing DCS template rather than creating a second one (the `template_name` default
is materialized into the validated payload, so an explicitly requested different name is not
recoverable downstream — fixing that properly means `normalizeDcsCreateMainSchemaPayload` must stop
defaulting and pass null through). A same-name template of another `templateType` is refused without the
flag and converted with it, detaching the foreign top-object from the FQN slot — destructive, but
explicitly opt-in and log-warned. All four DCS mutators now block on the export pipeline (default 120 s)
and can fail where they previously returned success immediately; that is the point, but it is a latency
and failure-mode change for callers.

Tests: `DcsSchemaSupportTest` (17), `DcsCreateMainSchemaRequestTest` (7),
`DcsMainSchemaPersistenceContractTest` (21 source-contract pins on the operation order, the extraFqn
export, the EOL guard and the honest state). First DCS tests in the repo. `attachTopObject` itself and
the `.dcs` appearing on disk stay live-only.

### bsl_list_methods / bsl_module_exports (2026-07-28) — doc-comment `См.` / `See` links are now reported, and the incoming premise was wrong

The report said "EDT resolves a doc link one hop only". **That premise is wrong, and the correction matters more
than the feature.** Decompiling `com._1c.g5.v8.dt.bsl.comment` (2025.2.3) shows
`BslDocumentationComment.computeReturnTypes` / `computeParameterTypes` recursing into the linked comment and
guarding loops with an `alreadyProcessingMethods` set — the resolution is already fully transitive. It only
*looks* like a single hop because the recursion is gated on the intermediate comment being a bare link
(`lastPart instanceof LinkPart && returnSection == null && parametersSection == null`): the first hop that
declares its own `Параметры:` / `Возвращаемое значение:` section wins outright and its own link is never walked.
There is nothing to fix in the resolver and nowhere to add a transitive walker — **do not write one.** Our own
repo, meanwhile, had no `See` handling at all — zero hops, not one: `BslSemanticService.extractDocumentation`
only scraped contiguous `//` lines.

What was added is reporting, not resolution: new dependency-free `BslDocSeeChain` in `core/edt/lang` exposes
`seeTarget` plus the in-module `seeChain` (depth 8, visited-set seeded with the start method, mirroring EDT's
own guard) with `seeChainTruncated` / `seeChainCrossModule` on `BslMethodInfo`. Rules were taken from the
decompiled source rather than guessed: the keywords are exactly `см.`/`see`, the link-text terminator set is
identifier chars plus `.` `:` `/`, the bracketed `(См. X)` form extends to the `)`, `@`-tag lines are not
scanned, and only the parameters/returns headers break a chain — `Пример:`, `Варианты вызова:`, `Устарела.`
end the description but not the chain. The module index is built from **all** module methods, not the exported
subset, because a chain routinely hops through a filtered-out helper. All four fields are omitted from the
payload when absent, so an ordinary method serializes byte-for-byte as before.

Three EDT parsing quirks that silently kill a chain are now pinned by tests and documented instead of being
normalised away (normalising would claim a resolution EDT does not perform): `См. МойМетод.` dangles, because
`LinkPart.computePartsWithOffset` splits on `.` keeping the empty tail; `См. также Модуль.Метод` links to
`также`; `См. Модуль.Метод()` stops at `(` and leaves `()` as trailing text, which unseats the link.
One deliberate deviation from EDT: the keyword must start at a word boundary, so `Просм.` / `Foreseen` are not
matched — EDT's raw `indexOf` does match them, and the boundary only removes false positives.

Tests: `BslDocSeeChainTest` (31 hermetic cases — both languages, case-insensitivity, link not last, cycles,
self-reference, depth truncation, cross-module, trailing period) + two serialization pins in
`BslSemanticToolsContractTest`. The contract sentence is single-sourced in `CONTRACT_HINT` so the two tool
descriptions cannot drift, with the full explanation in `knowledge/edt-gotchas.md`.

### get_diagnostics (2026-07-28) — review annotations from a sibling plugin were indistinguishable from EDT diagnostics

`collectFromMarkers` reads `file.findMarkers(null, true, DEPTH_ZERO)` — **every** marker type, subtypes
included, no allow-list (same on project scope with `DEPTH_INFINITE`). The sibling commit-review plugin
contributes `com.dudko.edt.review.commentMarker` (a `org.eclipse.core.resources.textmarker` subtype,
`persistent=true`) and never sets `IMarker.SEVERITY`, so `getAttribute(SEVERITY, -1)` returned `-1`,
`Severity.fromMarkerSeverity` mapped the default branch to `INFO`, the entry passed the default
`severity=info` threshold and landed in the diagnostics list with **nothing to tell it apart** — the
provenance the record already carried (`markerType` / `source`) was printed only under the
diagnostics-verbose debug gate.

Fix is a provenance label, not a type allow-list (an allow-list would silently lose newly contributed EDT
marker types). New dependency-free `DiagnosticOrigin` in core classifies `compiler` | `analyzer` |
`custom-check` | `review-annotation` | `unknown` from `(markerType, source, severityDeclared,
textMarkerSubtype)`; `EdtDiagnostic` gains an `origin` component filled by all four factories; the marker
loops classify **before** the severity gate and the dedup key, so foreign markers never enter `seen` or the
soft scan budget. `origin` is now rendered outside the debug gate for everything that is not
`compiler`/`analyzer` (collapsed groups carry an `[origin: x]` tag).

**Behavioural change:** the default answer is now clean diagnostics — new `origin` param defaults to
`diagnostics`, which excludes `review-annotation`; `origin=all` brings them back in a separate
`### Review annotations` section, and a single origin (or a comma list) narrows further. Review entries are
**never** counted in `errorCount`/`warningCount`/`infoCount`, even with `origin=all` — a review comment is
not an error/warning/info. Platform `taskmarker`/`bookmark` are deliberately exempt from the
severity-less-textmarker rule (they classify as `unknown` and keep flowing) so TODO markers do not silently
disappear.

Also removed a stray NUL byte inside a string literal in `EdtDiagnosticsCollector` (line 240 group-key
separator) which made ripgrep treat the whole file as binary and skip it in searches.

Tests: `DiagnosticOriginTest` (19 — rules + filter semantics), `DiagnosticOriginWiringContractTest`
(6 source-contract pins: origin in the record, origin rendered outside the debug gate, every
`findMarkers(null, …)` classifies + honours the filter, counters skip review, no NUL byte),
`GetDiagnosticsToolSchemaContractTest` (3 — the UI tool's schema parses and declares `origin`; MCP clients
strip undeclared params). Live validation pending.

### yaxunit_run (2026-07-28) — `total=0` read as "all tests passed"; red tests move to the success channel

`buildResult` decided green as `failures == 0 && errors == 0 && exitCode in {null, 0}` — `report.tests` was
never in the predicate, so an empty report satisfied it identically and a run that executed **zero** tests
returned `status: "passed"` on the success channel. Reachable in practice: `QaJUnitReport.parseDirectory`
returns non-null for any `*.xml` in the run dir and `getIntAttr` defaults a missing `tests` attribute to 0,
so both `<testsuites/>` and `<testsuite tests="0">` produce `report != null, tests == 0`.

The fix fixes the channel contract, not just the predicate: **the error channel means "there is no verdict —
draw no conclusions", the success channel means "there is a verdict — read the report"** (clients reliably
branch only on `McpHostRequestRouter`'s `isError = !result.isSuccess()`; the existing `preflight_warnings`
were walked past in the 07-14 incident). Two coupled consequences:

- A completed run with RED tests is now a **success** with `status: "tests_failed"` (was an error whose text
  was the JSON envelope) — closes feedback `2026-07-03-yaxunit-run-red-tests-as-mcp-error.md`, which showed
  6 of 10 "failures" in the weekly window were normal TDD iterations. Precedent: `qa_run` already returns
  `tests_failed` as success and `no_features`/`feature_not_found` (zero resolved work) as failure.
- A run that executed **zero tests** is now an **error**: `no_tests_found` when no filter was passed
  (`reason: no_tests_in_infobase`, pointing at the extension being missing/safe-mode), `no_tests_matched`
  when a filter was passed, with the cause split by EDT's equality state —
  `infobase_stale` (NOT_EQUAL/LOADING → run `update_infobase`), `filter_matched_nothing` (EQUAL → check
  `Модуль.Метод`, the `ИсполняемыеСценарии` registration, the `extensions` filter) or `no_match_unverified`
  (state unreadable on a cold EDT → both hints, stale first). The old vague `status: "failed"` is gone;
  exit≠0 with a green report is now `report_exit_mismatch` (error, inconclusive).

Mechanics: the decision is a pure `static Verdict classify(report, outcome, filterPresent, equalityState)`
(`record Verdict(status, reason, message, ok)`); `buildResult` only renders it and picks the channel.
`EdtRuntimeService.readInfobaseEqualityState` is read in preflight (best-effort, never throws) and reported
as `equality_state` on every run — including green ones, where it is the only cheap signal that the tests
ran against stale code; NOT_EQUAL/LOADING also raises a `preflight_warnings` entry.
**Read `equality_state` on every run, not only when something looks wrong.** A green run against a stale
infobase is the one failure mode this tool cannot detect for you: the tests really did pass, just not
against the code you just wrote. `equality_state` is the cheapest available proof that they did — checking
it always is strictly better than reaching for `get_infobase_sync_state` after a result looks suspicious. `getDescription()` and
the schema now carry the input decision ("run update_infobase after editing .bsl") instead of output-format
prose; the empty-log detail moved to `resources/knowledge/edt-gotchas.md`.

Tests: `classify_*` (8, incl. the ok=true pin for red tests) and `classifyNoReport_*` (3, previously
uncovered) in `YaxunitRunToolTest`. Live validation pending.

### yaxunit_run (2026-07-28) — the run dir is also the client's CWD, so any stray `*.xml` became "the report"

`QaJUnitReport.parseDirectory` walked the whole directory for `*.xml` and summed everything it found. For
`yaxunit_run` that directory is also the thin client's working directory (`processBuilder.directory(runDir)`),
so any unrelated XML dropped there was silently counted as the jUnit report. New overload
`parseDirectory(dir, maxFailureDetails, preferredFileName)`: with a preferred name only files with that name
are parsed; when it is absent but other `*.xml` are present the legacy scan still runs but sets the new
`fallbackScan` flag, which `yaxunit_run` surfaces as `report_source` (`junit.xml` | `fallback_xml_scan`) plus
a `report_source_note` — back-compatible, never silent. A fallback scan that yields 0 tests is routed to the
existing `no_report` diagnosis so the richer safe-mode hint is not lost. `qa_run` keeps the 2-arg call: its
`junit` directory is dedicated and Vanessa writes one file per feature there, so nothing changes for it.

Tests: `reportParsesEmptyRootAsZeroTests`, `reportParsesZeroTestSuiteAndMissingTestsAttribute`,
`reportPrefersJunitXmlOverStrayXmlInTheRunDir`, `reportFlagsFallbackWhenOnlyStrayXmlIsPresent`.

### qa_run (2026-07-28) — a report with zero executed tests no longer reads as `passed`

Same defect class as `yaxunit_run`: `status = (failures + errors) > 0 ? "tests_failed" : "passed"` never
looked at `report.tests`, so a parsed-but-empty jUnit report surfaced as a pass. A finished run whose report
contains 0 executed tests is now `status: "no_tests_executed"` with a `message` (scenarios filtered out,
Vanessa aborted before the FeaturePlayer, or the infobase does not match the EDT source) and it travels on
the **error** channel (`QA_RUN_ERROR: the run executed 0 tests` + the full envelope) — consistent with
`no_features`/`feature_not_found`, which already fail for zero resolved work. Red tests keep their existing
success channel with `tests_failed`; `timeout`/`infra_error`/`update_failed` channels are unchanged.

### yaxunit_run (2026-07-28) — orphaned `1cv8c` is now reaped per-infobase instead of warned about globally

The preflight scanned **every** process on the machine for the substring `1cv8c` with no project/infobase
binding and only warned: on a multi-stand box that fires on every run and cannot tell our leaked client from
a neighbouring stand's legitimate one. And `terminateProcessTree` never cleaned the leak up, because the real
`1cv8c` is not a descendant of the process we spawn — the launcher reparents it, and the incident logs show
`descendants=0` on every heartbeat — so the orphan has to be found by command line and killed by PID.

New `InfobaseProcessScanner.killLeakedTestClients(ibPath)` returning
`TestClientCleanup(killed, spared, unreadable)`, reusing the existing WMI command-line overlay (mandatory —
`ProcessHandle.info().commandLine()` is empty on Windows). The kill predicate is triple-gated: the process is
a thin client (`1cv8c`), it carries **our** `RunUnitTests=` startup parameter (an interactive session never
does), and its command line references **this** infobase (`matchesIb`, boundary-checked). Anything that
cannot be attributed — a server infobase, an unresolved association, or an unreadable command line because
WMI is unavailable — is reported loudly with its PIDs and left running: killing without an infobase match
could take down another stand's client.

The gate encodes a rule worth reusing wherever this plugin destroys something: **what you could not
attribute, you do not destroy — you report it.** An unreadable command line is not permission to guess; it
is the reason to stop and name the PIDs so a human can decide. Note the asymmetry that makes this cheap:
failing to reap a leaked client costs one warning and a retry, while killing a neighbouring stand's client
costs someone else's session with no way to tell them why it died. `fileIbPath` is now public (the binding key is needed from
`tools.qa`); the preflight warning is scoped to this run instead of the whole machine.

Tests: `isLeakedTestClient_*` (our runner on the target IB / the same runner on another IB / an interactive
client of the target IB / unknown IB path / thick client and designer), `isThinClientAndUnitTestRunner_areNullSafe`,
`hasReadableCommandLine_falseWhenOnlyTheExeIsVisible`. The `ProcessHandle` scan/kill itself is
environment-dependent and not unit-covered; live validation pending.

### BF-13330 (2026-07-28) — dynamic list: `customQuery` / `queryText` / `mainTable` are finally authorable

Switching a dynamic list from auto to a custom query had no working path. `set_item set:{customQuery:true}`
failed with `Unknown form property: customQuery`, `apply_form_recipe attributes:[{set:{customQuery:…}}]` failed
identically, and `type:"DynamicList"` failed with the opaque `Type not found in BM: DynamicList`. The property
was never missing — it lives one level deeper, on the attribute's `form:DynamicListExtInfo`, and the generic
feature resolver (`resolveStructuralFeatureIgnoreCase`) only ever inspects `target.eClass()`. `set_item` was a
dead end for a second reason: it resolves form ITEMS, whose ids are an independent id space from form
attributes, so an attribute property can never arrive there. The nested `set:{extInfo:{…}}` form did exist but
was undocumented and threw `Attribute extInfo is not initialized for patch` whenever the extInfo was absent.

- New pure-Java `DynamicListExtInfoRules` — a **strict whitelist** of the 14 `DynamicListExtInfo` features
  (plus the `query` → `queryText` alias) with `hoist()` / `canonicalize()`. Deliberately not a generic "no such
  feature on the target → look inside extInfo" rule: that would silently swallow typos for every ExtInfo kind
  (ValueTable / ValueTree / DCS) and turn a fail-loud `Unknown form property` into a no-op.
- `applyFormAttributePatch` — the single choke point all three entry points share — now hoists the flat keys
  before the generic pass and merges them with an explicit `set:{extInfo:{…}}` block (canonicalized on both
  sides, explicit wins on conflict). The legacy flat `dynamicDataRead` branch is kept for backward
  compatibility but now only *contributes* to that merged patch, so the value is applied exactly once.
- New `applyDynamicListExtInfo` reproduces the form editor's `ChangeDynamicListExtInfoCustomQueryTask` by hand
  (that task is a `BmBasicTask1` and would open a nested transaction inside our `executeWrite`):
  `customQuery=true` generates `queryText` from `mainTable` via `DynamicListAttributeService.createQueryText`
  when none was passed and none is stored — and **reports the generated text back in the operation summary**,
  so the caller sees what was written; `customQuery=false` clears `fields`/`calculatedFields`/`parameters` and
  drops `queryText`; `mainTable` is assigned from exactly one place, so flipping `customQuery` either way
  preserves it. A contradictory `customQuery=false` + `queryText` patch is rejected.
- `ensureDynamicListExtInfo` materializes the missing companion (mirroring `ensureFormFieldExtInfo` /
  `ensureFormGroupExtInfo`) instead of the old blanket refusal; a non-DynamicList attribute is rejected with its
  real `valueType` named. `mainTable` binds from a metadata FQN through `dbViewDefs → mainView`, read
  reflectively to avoid importing the dozens of typed `*DbViewDefs` interfaces (new `Import-Package:
  com._1c.g5.v8.dt.metadata.dbview`).
- The DCS containment collections (`fields`, `calculatedFields`, `parameters`, `listSettings`) are **refused
  explicitly, not ignored**: the editor task does not populate them either, and the platform derives available
  fields from `queryText` when `autoFillAvailableFields=true`.
- New `mutate_form_model` op **`set_attribute_props`** (aliases `set_attribute`, `update_attribute`) — the root
  cause of the whole episode was that `set_item` was the only visible verb for "fix one property", while
  attributes were reachable only through `set_form_props set:{attributes:[…]}`.
- Two guard rails so the next caller does not repeat the search: `type:"DynamicList"` is early-rejected in both
  validators with a redirect to `customQuery`/`queryText`, and the generic resolver now answers a
  DynamicList-only key on the wrong target by explaining the attribute-vs-item id-space split and naming the
  working call.

Tests: `DynamicListExtInfoRulesTest` (whitelist, aliases, snake/camel/kebab, explicit-block precedence, and no
false positives on generic FormAttribute keys) + source-contract `DynamicListExtInfoContractTest` (form/EMF
types resolve only in the OSGi runtime). Schemas of both form tools and `knowledge/managed-forms.md` document
the auto → custom-query recipe and the `autoFillAvailableFields` caveat. Live validation pending.

### BF-13330 (2026-07-28) — `add_button`: accept the `Form.Command.<Name>` a `.form` actually carries

`add_button command_name:"Form.Command.X"` failed with `Form command not found`. `findFormCommandByName`
compared the raw string against `FormCommand.getName()` (the bare name), while `Form.Command.X` is exactly the
notation the BM serializer writes into `<commandName>` — so a caller echoing back what it had just read from
its own `.form` was not inventing a format.

- `stripFormCommandPrefix` removes `Form.Command.` / `FormCommand.` / `Command.` case-insensitively inside
  `findFormCommandByName`; a bare name keeps working unchanged.
- `Form.StandardCommand.*` is rejected with `INVALID_METADATA_CHANGE` explaining that standard form commands are
  platform-provided and appear in the auto command bar on their own — they are not form-local.
- A foreign-namespace FQN (`Catalog.X.Command.Y`, `CommonCommand.Z`) is rejected with `METADATA_NOT_FOUND`
  explaining that `add_button` resolves only `Form.getFormCommands()`, and suggesting a form command whose
  handler calls the object command. Object commands stay out of scope for now.
- The not-found message now lists the form's available command names, the same courtesy `remove_command`
  already extends, and the schema states that both formats are accepted.

Source-contract test `AddButtonCommandNameContractTest`. Live validation pending.

### Shared-infobase fan-out for sync-state and update reporting (2026-07-28) — a green project is not a green infobase

EDT's equality state belongs to a (project, infobase) PAIR, which is correct semantics but was reported
as if it described the infobase. When several projects share one infobase — a configuration plus its
extensions, or two configuration projects on one `.1CD` — `get_infobase_sync_state` answered EQUAL for
the project it was asked about while an extension sat unapplied, and `update_infobase` reported
`skipped, equality_state=EQUAL` for the same reason. Both read as "the infobase is current". Nobody
fanned out over the neighbours; EDT exposes no enumeration of the projects bound to an infobase
(`IInfobaseAssociationManager.getAssociation(InfobaseReference)` is a first-match lookup).

New `InfobaseSiblingResolver` runs `resolveDefaultInfobase` over the open workspace projects and matches
on `InfobaseIdentity.canonical` — the plugin's single "same infobase" rule, already used by the lease
guard — gated by the non-blocking `peekV8ProjectManager` peek so a cold EDT cannot park the caller for
30 s. Relations are classified: a configuration and its extensions MUST converge, so a NOT_EQUAL there is
a real staleness signal; two independent configuration projects are mutually exclusive by construction
and stay informational; LOADING/absent is reported as `unknown`, never as stale. The aggregation is a
pure function, unit-tested without EDT. `get_infobase_sync_state` now reports `siblings`,
`shared_infobase`, `sibling_projects_stale` and `all_projects_work_ready` (opt out with
`include_siblings=false`); `work_ready` keeps its per-project meaning for backward compatibility.
`update_infobase` annotates `sibling_projects_stale` + `sibling_warning` on the sync, async and
skipped-because-EQUAL payloads — output only, no new input parameters. The `dynamic_only` payload also
gained a forward-warning that a later EQUAL does not prove the deferred restructure ran.

### In-flight update guard keyed by infobase, not project (2026-07-28) — shared-IB double-fire now refused

EDT applies an update through a Designer session that is single-connection per INFOBASE, but the BF-12705
guard was keyed by project name. Two different projects bound to the same infobase therefore both passed
the guard and collided on the one Designer connection — exactly the failure the guard exists to prevent.

The guard key is now the canonical infobase identity (`InfobaseIdentity.canonical`, tolerant of slash
direction, case and a trailing separator), falling back to the project name when the infobase does not
resolve; dry runs neither acquire the slot nor pay for the resolution. The slot value now carries the
owning project alongside the job id, and the `UPDATE_ALREADY_RUNNING` payload reports `in_flight_project`
with a message that names the *other* project holding the infobase — without it, "already running" reads
as nonsense for a project that started no update. This is a deliberate behaviour change: on a shared
infobase some calls that previously proceeded now get UPDATE_ALREADY_RUNNING.

### Damaged target database classified instead of masked as IB_LOCKED (2026-07-28)

A physically damaged target database ("the integrity of configuration structure is violated") failed its
config-export step with a temp `xml.zip` message, and `isBlockedByLockedIB` matches a bare "xml.zip"
substring anywhere in the cause chain — so a broken database was reported as IB_LOCKED and the caller was
sent hunting for a lock holder that did not exist. Tools that read only the EDT model (`get_diagnostics`,
`metadata_smoke`) stayed green throughout, reinforcing the wrong conclusion.

New `TARGET_INFOBASE_DAMAGED` error code with an `isTargetDbDamaged` cause-chain predicate (EN + RU
platform tokens), evaluated BEFORE the locked-IB heuristic so the specific cause wins. The payload
explains that the TARGET DATABASE is damaged — not the configuration in git and not a lock — gives the
concrete repair command (`chdbfl.exe -s "<ib-dir>\1Cv8.1CD"`, or Designer → Testing and repair) and notes
that EDT-model-only tools are green here by design. Because the platform's exact wording has never been
observed live, both a successful classification and every unclassified UPDATE_FAILED now echo the raw
cause chain into `raw_error` and the bundle log, so the first live occurrence confirms or refutes the
token set without a separate diagnostic build.

### metadata_smoke states its non-goal (2026-07-28) — wording only

"Use metadata_smoke for headless verification" invited the reading that a green smoke report meant the
environment was verified. It never did: the tool creates and deletes temporary objects through the EDT
metadata API and probes a read-only BM transaction against the PROJECT MODEL, and never opens the target
infobase. The dispatcher description, the tool description and the report header (`scope: EDT metadata
API (project model only) — target infobase NOT verified`) now say so explicitly and point at
`get_infobase_sync_state` / `update_infobase` for infobase readiness. No logic changed; a unit test pins
the wording against regression.

### BF-13159 (2026-07-28) — `web_publication register_server`: raw `SWTException: Invalid thread access`

`register_server` returned a non-JSON `Exception: Invalid thread access` while `list_servers` afterwards showed
the server as registered. Not a response-marshalling problem: decompiling services.core 21.0 shows
`WebServerManager.add` first `save(webServers)` (persist + reload event) and only then, **synchronously on the
calling thread**, `fireWebServerAddedEvent`. `WebPublicationTool.doExecute` runs on an MCP worker thread, so the
unguarded UI listeners in `com._1c.g5.v8.dt.platform.services.ui` — `WebServerEditor.webServersReloaded` →
`bind(...)` and `AbstractPublicationEditor`/`InfobasePublicationEditor.webServersReloaded` → `close(false)` —
throw off-thread *after* the registration is already durable. The trigger is an OPEN web-server/publication
editor, not an open view (`WebServersView` is `asyncExec`-guarded). The raw text escaped because `doExecute`
only caught `EdtToolException`, and an async failure bypasses `AbstractTool.execute`'s synchronous try/catch, so
`ToolExecutionService` rendered `"Exception: " + message`.

Fixed in two layers:
- `EdtWebPublicationService.onUiThread(Supplier)` (+ `uiThreadDisplay()`): hops the mutation onto the SWT UI
  thread via `syncExec` with a RuntimeException relay, inline when already on the UI thread or headless.
  Never calls `Display.getDefault()` (that would create a display on the worker thread). Wraps
  `manager.add(server)` and — same hole, `firePublicationRemovedEvent` → `AbstractPublicationEditor
  .publicationRemoved` → unguarded `close(false)` — `manager.remove(server, publication)` in
  `removePublication`. `publish` was never affected because we drive the publish delegate directly and
  `firePublishedEvent` never runs. Own seam rather than `UiThreadExecutor`, which reports failures as the
  wrong exception family (`EdtAstException`); `protected` so tests can replace the hop.
- `WebPublicationTool`: a `catch (RuntimeException)` belt next to the `EdtToolException` one always answers
  structured JSON (`WEB_SERVER_ACCESS_FAILED` + the failure type and message), and `doRegisterServer` now
  re-reads the registry through the new `EdtWebPublicationService.findServer(name)` on a runtime failure — a
  registration that persisted is reported as success with `registered_with_ui_warning: true`, a `ui_warning`
  advisory and `status: "ok_with_warning"` instead of a failure the caller cannot act on.

Tests: `registerServerRuntimeFailureReturnsStructuredError`, `registerServerSurvivesUiListenerFailureWithAdvisory`,
`unexpectedRuntimeFailureIsStructuredJson`. The `syncExec` hop itself is not unit-covered — the tests bundle runs
on plain maven-surefire with no workbench. Live validation pending: the reproduction needs a web-server editor
open in EDT, and the `syncExec` hop wants one deliberate "register while the EDT UI thread is busy" pass to rule
out a deadlock.

### BF-13159 (2026-07-28) — `web_publication`: the inline probe of publish/restart never got credentials

`publish`/`restart` have run the same `runProbe` as `action=probe` since `da405ea` — `probe_user`/`probe_password`
are read from the shared parameter map and passed straight to `EdtWebPublicationService.probe(url, timeoutMs,
user, password)`, and `ToolArgumentParser` does not filter by schema. The defect was purely in the schema texts:
both credential params were documented starting with `probe: …`, so a caller read them as "only for
action=probe" and never sent them with a publish. The inline self-verification then went out unauthenticated and
any 1C HTTP/web service with mandatory authentication answered 401 — a guaranteed false "the publication does
not work" right after a publication that was in fact fine.

`probe_url`, `probe_user` and `probe_password` are now all prefixed `publish/restart/probe:` and say explicitly
that the credentials apply to the inline check too, and that without them it is UNAUTHENTICATED and returns 401
on a protected endpoint. `getDescription()` gained one sentence: publish/restart self-verify in the same call
when `probe_url` is given. No behaviour change — text only. Pinned by
`WebPublicationToolStandaloneTest.publishInlineProbeCarriesCredentials` /
`restartInlineProbeCarriesCredentials`, which assert the stub receives both user and password for
`action=publish` and `action=restart`.

Deliberately NOT done: reusing the `infobase_connection` credentials for the probe (not confirmed by the owner).

### BF-13405 (2026-07-28) — `add_metadata_child` advertised malformed JSON, so the tool was uncallable

`AddMetadataChildTool`'s `properties` description carried a JSON sample written as `[\"DocumentRef.Invoice\"]`
inside a Java text block. A text block **does** process `\"` and emits a bare `"`, which terminated the JSON
string early — the whole schema failed to parse (`MalformedJsonException: Unterminated object … path
$.properties.properties.description`) and callers could not invoke the tool at all. Introduced by `f184637`
(the `commandParameterType` + `group` work), where the sample was added. Correct form is `\\"`, already used
in `EdtMetadataDetailsTool` and `MutateFormModelTool` — only this one site was wrong.

`ToolSchemaValidityTest` exists for exactly this regression class (its javadoc cites the earlier `qa_run`
unescaped-quote incident that silently bypassed the `features` filter), but its tool list was hardcoded to
seven tools and covered no metadata or form tool — which is why the break shipped. The list now also covers
`add_metadata_child`, `create_metadata`, `update_metadata`, `edt_metadata_details`, `rights_manage`,
`mutate_form_model`, `apply_form_recipe`, `dcs_manage` and `web_publication`; all sixteen instantiate outside
the OSGi runtime, so the guard stays a plain compile-cycle test. Found independently by two diagnostic passes
over the BF-13405 and `dcs_create_main_schema` reports, and confirmed by the reporter's live parse error.

### BF-12936 / BF-12562 (2026-07-20) — `mutate_form_model remove_command`: delete a form-local command

The command-relocation refactor (form-local commands → register-owned commands) could not be finished:
after re-pointing the buttons, the old form commands could not be deleted. `remove_item` rejects them
("Cannot remove root form container item") because form commands live in `Form.getFormCommands()`, not the
UI item tree; and dropping their BSL handler in isolation raised "handler not found" — so the refactor
finished only with dead metadata (BF-12562 Issue 3).

New `mutate_form_model` op **`remove_command`** (aliases `remove_form_command`, `delete_command`):
- Resolves the target form command by `command_name` or `command_id` (the shared `resolveRequiredFormCommand`).
- Collects every button referencing it (`collectReferencingButtons`, walking `eAllContents()` — covers both
  the `CommandRef` wrapper and a direct reference).
- **Refuses by default** with `METADATA_DELETE_CONFLICT` when buttons still reference it, listing them —
  no silent orphaning. Pass `remove_referencing_buttons=true` (alias `force`) to detach those buttons from
  their parent containers and drop them together with the command.
- Removes the command from `getFormCommands()`; its contained `action → FormCommandHandlerContainer →
  CommandHandler` subtree goes with it atomically (no "handler not found"). The BSL handler procedure in the
  form module is left untouched (a harmless orphan; the module still compiles).

Source-contract test `RemoveCommandContractTest` (form/EMF types resolve only in the OSGi runtime, so the
structure is pinned like `RenameCommandContractTest`). Schema + `op`-required hint document `remove_command`.
**Live-validated** on the sandbox (`Catalog.Catalog.Forms.ItemForm`, build `-2130`): removing an orphan form
command succeeded (`buttons_removed=0`); removing a button-referenced command without the flag failed loud
with `METADATA_DELETE_CONFLICT` naming the button; `remove_referencing_buttons=true` removed the command and
its button together — and the `Form.form` on disk was left clean of both.

### BF-12936 (2026-07-20) — author a Command's `commandParameterType` + `group` (no more silent drop)

Relocating form-local commands to register-owned commands was blocked: there was no plugin-only path to
give a `Command` a `commandParameterType` or a `group`, forcing a rule-violating hand-edit of the `.mdo`.
Root causes (all confirmed by decompiling the EDT 2025.2.3 model — `InformationRegisterCommand` →
`BasicCommand`):

- **`commandParameterType` is a containment `mcore.TypeDescription`** (like an attribute's `type`), so the
  generic reference setter rejected it with `[INVALID_METADATA_CHANGE] Containment reference updates are not
  supported in set`.
- **`group` is an `mcore.CommandGroup` reference**; standard command-interface groups (e.g.
  `FormCommandBarImportant`) are addressed by a bare name, not an FQN, so `set={group:"FormCommandBar"}`
  hit `resolveByFqn` and failed with the misleading `[METADATA_PARENT_NOT_FOUND] Parent FQN must be …`.
- **`add_metadata_child` silently dropped both** (and `representation`): its create path applied only
  name/synonym for a `Command` because the property applier early-returned for any non-`BasicFeature` child.

Fix — one call now authors a fully-formed command, via both `add_metadata_child` and `update_metadata`:

- `applyReferenceValue` gains a TypeDescription-containment branch: a TypeDescription-valued containment
  reference (any command's `commandParameterType`) is built from the requested type(s) — scalar or array —
  resolved in the write-transaction namespace (`applyTypeDescriptionReference`), instead of being rejected.
- `applyReferenceValue` gains a CommandGroup branch (`resolveCommandGroupValue`): a dotted value resolves a
  user-defined `CommandGroup` object by FQN; a bare name resolves a standard group to a proxy through the
  platform `IEObjectProvider` (same mechanism the plugin already uses for platform types). An unknown
  standard name now fails loud with the **live list of valid group names** rather than a parent-FQN error.
- `add_metadata_child` create path (single + batch) calls the new `applyCommandProperties`, routing every
  supplied `Command` property through the shared feature setter — fail-loud on an unknown field, never a
  silent drop.
- `add_metadata_child` schema documents the `Command` properties (`commandParameterType`, `group`,
  `representation`, `parameterUseMode`, `modifiesData`, `shortcut`).

Unit test `AddMetadataChildToolCommandPropertiesTest` pins the tool-level plumbing (the properties survive
validation normalization + the validation token and reach the service request). **Live-validated** on the
sandbox EDT (project `TestConfiguration`, build `-2052`): a single `add_metadata_child` wrote
`<group>FormCommandBarImportant</group>` + `<commandParameterType><types>CatalogRef.Catalog</types></commandParameterType>`
+ `<representation>Auto</representation>` into the owner `.mdo`; `update_metadata set={commandParameterType}`
succeeded on the existing command; and `group:"FormCommandBar"` failed loud with the live valid-group list
(confirming the repro's `FormCommandBar` was an invalid name — the real one is `FormCommandBarImportant`).

### BF-13159 (2026-07-18) — `web_publication publish` Alias trailing-separator (403) + extension-services gate (404)

Follow-up after the registry fix below unblocked `publish` live (build `-1751`): the call now writes a
vrd + touches the conf, but the published `BSLAnalyzerService` still didn't answer 200. Two distinct
defects, both fixed:

- **Gap A — 403 (`AH01630`): generated `Alias` target lacked a trailing separator.** On a re-point, EDT's
  publish delegate writes `Alias "/<name>" "<location>"` with `<location>` = `publication.getLocation()`
  verbatim, while `<name>` is EDT's stored publication name (**trailing slash**, e.g. `agent-current/`).
  Apache concatenates the request remainder onto the target with **no** separator, so
  `/agent-current/hs/…` resolves under `…\published\agent-currenths\…` → `client denied` (403). Fix: new
  pure helper `EdtWebPublicationService.vrdLocation(location, name)` appends `File.separator` to the
  location when the publication name is slash-terminated but the location is not (a bare-name fresh
  publish keeps the remainder's own leading slash and is left unchanged). Unit test
  `EdtWebPublicationServiceHelpersTest`.
- **Gap B — 404: `publishExtensionsByDefault="false"` suppressed the extension owning the service.** The
  forced `false` (commit `38a6066`) was introduced as an NPE workaround, but the NPE was actually the
  **null web-extension `Path`** that `IPublicationManager.publish` hands the delegate (`aconst_null`, decompile-
  confirmed) — already fixed by driving the delegate directly with a non-null `Path`. The delegate does
  **not** enumerate project extensions (decompiled), so `false` was pure collateral: it stopped the
  `BSL_Analyzer` extension (which owns `BSLAnalyzerService`) from being published at all → 404, breaking
  the fleet's primary use case. Fix: `applyExtras` no longer forces `false`; it sets
  `publishExtensionsByDefault` only when the caller passes the new `publish_extensions_by_default` param,
  otherwise leaves EMF's default (`true`) — matching the hand-authored vrd that served the service. New
  schema param wired through `parsePublicationExtras`/`appendExtras` (infra found the undocumented param
  was silently ignored before). Test in `WebPublicationToolStandaloneTest`.

Build green (`-Plocal-target`); injector route + live 200 pending the next install round.
(feedback `2026-07-17-web-publication-webserverpublishdelegateregistry-unavailable`, Gaps A/B)

### BF-13159 (2026-07-17) — `web_publication publish` no longer times out on `IWebServerPublishDelegateRegistry`

- **`web_publication action=publish` failed after a 30s wait with `WEB_SERVER_ACCESS_FAILED: "EDT service
  not available: IWebServerPublishDelegateRegistry"`** — reproducibly, on a healthy stack (`list_servers`
  and `get` worked). Root cause (decompile audit of `platform.services.core 21.0`): unlike its siblings
  `IWebServerManager` / `IPublicationManager`, `IWebServerPublishDelegateRegistry` is bound **only in EDT's
  platform-services Guice injector** (`PlatformServicesCoreModule`) and is **not** among the interfaces the
  activator exports as OSGi services (`InjectorAwareServiceRegistrator`). The plugin looked it up with an
  OSGi `ServiceTracker.waitForService(30s)` — the same mechanism EDT's own `com._1c.g5.wiring.ServiceAccess`
  uses — so the lookup could never resolve it and always waited the full timeout. Not a headless /
  lazy-activation / "Servers view" issue; the lookup mechanism was simply wrong for an injector-only binding.
- **Fix:** new `PublishDelegateRegistryResolver` resolves the registry from the injector — `PlatformServicesCore`
  `getDefault()` → package-private `getInjector()` (reflected; classes loaded via the platform-services
  bundle's own class loader, no new `Import-Package`) → `Injector.getInstance(...)` — with a fallback that
  reads the registry EDT's `PublicationManager` (the OSGi `IPublicationManager`) keeps injected, matched by
  assignable type so a field rename can't break it. `VibeCorePlugin.getWebServerPublishDelegateRegistry()`
  now: non-blocking OSGi fast-path (forward-compat) → injector → `PublicationManager` field; the 30s wait is
  gone. Two independent reflective routes minimise EDT-version fragility. Unit test:
  `PublishDelegateRegistryResolverTest` (field-by-type + null-safety); injector route covered by live
  validation. (feedback `2026-07-17-web-publication-webserverpublishdelegateregistry-unavailable`)

### BF-12936 (2026-07-17) — `grep` honest hint when a literal search hides a regex-intent pattern

- **`grep` now hints on a zero-match LITERAL search whose pattern carries regex syntax.** `grep`'s
  `regex` param defaults to false, so the pattern is `Pattern.quote`d and matched literally — an
  alternation like `A|B|C` is searched as the single string `"A|B|C"` (pipes included) and returns a
  clean "0 matches" that reads as "not present" even when each term IS present. Confirmed live on
  stack-2 as a caller footgun (a `ЮТ_X|ЮТ_Y|…` pattern without `regex:true` → 0 matches; the same names
  found individually and with `regex:true`) — a recurring class (feedback `2026-07-11` and `2026-07-16`,
  both pipe patterns). Fix: on a zero-match result with `regex=false`, when the pattern looks like it
  was meant as a regex (contains `|`, `^`/`$` anchors, `.*`/`.+`, a `[..]` class, or `\d`/`\w`… escape
  classes — a bare `.` is ignored so FQNs like `Catalog.Foo` don't trip it), append a one-line hint to
  re-run with `regex:true`. The literal default is unchanged (no behaviour/regression change); the
  `regex` schema description now spells out the literal-matching semantics too. Unit test:
  `GrepRegexIntentTest` (the pure `looksLikeRegexIntent` heuristic). Build green (`-Plocal-target`).
  (feedback `2026-07-16-grep-false-negative-on-present-method-names`)

### BF-12936 (2026-07-16) — `web_publication publish` can carry custom HTTP services into the vrd

- **`web_publication publish` now accepts publication content beyond the plain infobase binding**, so an
  EDT-managed publication can reproduce a hand-authored `default.vrd`'s custom HTTP services and flags:
  `http_services: [{name, root_url, enable}]`, `publish_http_by_default`, `publish_web_by_default`,
  `enable_standard_odata`, `enable_system_analytics`, and a publication-level `pool: {size, max_age}`. These
  map onto the EDT `InfobasePublication` model (`HttpServices`/`HttpService.rootUrl`, `OData`,
  `enableSystemAnalytics`, `Pool`) and the publish delegate serializes them into the generated vrd. Unblocks
  making script-managed sandbox publications first-class EDT-managed — chiefly reproducing
  `<service name="BSLAnalyzerService" rootUrl="bsl-analyzer">` (the bsl-analyzer-workspace MCP dependency),
  which the bare publish silently dropped. Feasibility + design:
  `TaskArtifacts/BF-12008/BF-12936/edt-optione1-feasibility.md`.
- **Documented fidelity limit:** the EDT `HttpService` model is `{name, rootUrl, enable}` only — per-service
  pool tuning (`reuseSessions`/`sessionMaxAge`/`poolSize` on a `<service>`) is not representable (only the
  publication-level `Pool`). A migrated publication is functionally faithful (the service publishes at its
  `rootUrl`) but not byte-identical on per-service pool numbers.
- Unit tests: `WebPublicationExtrasParsingTest` (the pure param→options parser). The model→vrd serialization
  is EDT's — validated live (battle test on stack-2). Build green (`-Plocal-target`).
- **Follow-up fix (battle-test NPE — `webExtensions is null`):** the first live option-1 publish crashed
  with `NullPointerException: … "webExtensions" is null`. Root cause (confirmed in services.core 21.0
  bytecode): `PublicationManager.publish(pub, server)` passes a **null** web-extension `Path` to the Apache
  publish delegate (`aconst_null`), and the delegate dereferences it (`.toString()`) when the vrd carries
  `<httpServices>` — so a plain infobase publish always worked but an `http_services` publish NPE'd,
  unconditionally (independent of `publishExtensionsByDefault`). Fix: the `wsap_version`-absent publish
  branch no longer calls `manager.publish` (which nulls the path); it resolves the module itself
  (`IPublicationManager.getWebExtension`, which reads the conf's `LoadModule _1cws_module`) and drives the
  delegate directly with a non-null `Path` (null → clear `WEB_EXTENSION_NOT_FOUND` telling the caller to
  pass `wsap_version`). Also hardened earlier: `publishExtensionsByDefault(false)` (faithful to the hand
  vrds; avoids extension enumeration) and a `RuntimeException`→structured-`WEB_SERVER_ACCESS_FAILED` wrap so
  a delegate crash never surfaces as a raw NPE. The `rootUrl="bsl-analyzer"` serialization was confirmed
  correct in the crashed vrd — option-1's core premise holds. (feedback

### BF-12936 feedback (2026-07-16) — `mutate_form_model` form titles leaked `ru` in EN-primary projects

- **`add_command` / `rename_command` / `set_item` titles now land in the project's primary content
  language instead of always `ru`.** A plain-string `title` was written under `<key>ru</key>` even in
  English-primary projects, while `create_metadata` synonyms correctly resolved to `en` — the divergence
  was `resolveProjectDefaultLanguageCode(form)`, which walked `EcoreUtil.getRootContainer(form)`: a Form
  EObject lives in its own `.form` resource, so the root container is never the `Configuration` and the
  resolver always fell back to `ru`. A Configuration-aware overload now resolves the title's default
  locale via the same `resolveSynonymLocaleKey` the synonym path uses (default language → first
  configured language → `ru`), threaded through the form-mutation dispatcher (which has the
  Configuration in scope) into `add_command`, `rename_command`, and `set_item`'s title handling. The
  rare `itemManagementService == null` fallback (new table/decoration titles) keeps the prior ctx-only
  resolution. Correctness rests on the already-tested `BmSynonymLocaleResolver`; live confirmation on the
  AM project pending. (feedback `2026-07-16-mutate-form-model-add-command-title-locale-defaults-ru`)
- Residual (queued, not in this change): no op removes/replaces a *specific* stray title-locale key on an
  existing command (only prevents new ones).

### BF-12936 feedback (2026-07-16) — `update_metadata` localized strings also leaked `ru`

- **`update_metadata` `set:{synonym|objectPresentation|listPresentation|…}` with a plain string now lands
  in the project's default content language, not a hard-coded `ru`.** The addendum to the form-title note
  reported the same leak on `recordPresentation`/`listPresentation`; the shared cause was the
  `update_metadata` localized-string writers (`applyEMapStringPatch` / `applyStringMapPatch`) hard-coding
  `RU_LANGUAGE` for a plain string — so `create_metadata` synonyms resolved to `en` (via
  `setCommonProperties`→`resolveSynonymLocaleKey`) but the *update* path always wrote `ru`. Both writers +
  the synonym set/unset now resolve the locale key via the same `resolveSynonymLocaleKey`, threading the
  `Configuration` (already in scope at every call site). Fixes synonym and every localized presentation
  property in one choke-point. `BmSynonymLocaleResolver` (already tested) backs the resolution; live
  confirmation pending. (feedback `…add-command-title-locale-defaults-ru`, addendum)

### BF-12936 feedback (2026-07-16) — `mutate_form_model set_item userVisible` flat per-role map

- **A flat per-role `userVisible` map no longer silently wipes the item's visibility default.** The tool
  description advertises `userVisible` as accepting a "per-role map", but `set_item` only implemented the
  structured `{common, for:[{role,value}]}` shape — a flat `{common:false, "RoleName":true}` (the shape
  the description invites) dropped every role key and applied only `common=false`, wiping the working
  default to hidden-for-everyone (a destructive, data-losing no-op). `EdtMetadataService` now harvests a
  flat map's role→bool keys (`parseFlatRoleEntries`) when no `for` key is present, skipping the reserved
  `common`/`value`/`visible`/`enabled`/`for` keys; a non-boolean role value is rejected rather than
  silently dropped. Both accepted shapes are now documented on the tool. (feedback
  `2026-07-16-mutate-form-model-set-item-uservisible-by-role-breaks-default`)
- Unit tests: 6 new cases in `UserVisibleForRoleParsingTest` (incl. the exact reported input). Build
  green (`-Plocal-target`, 17/17).

### BF-12936 feedback (2026-07-16) — `update_infobase` job-id/timeout ergonomics

- **`update_infobase` no longer tells a caller to poll a job id that cannot be resolved.** A
  synchronous (or just-registering async) update holds the in-flight guard slot with a `"sync"` /
  `"starting"` sentinel, not a `BackgroundJobRegistry` job. The `UPDATE_ALREADY_RUNNING` rejection used
  to emit `in_flight_job_id: "sync"` + a "poll `update_infobase_status(job_id="sync")`" hint, which dead-
  ended at `Unknown job: sync`. Now the payload distinguishes a real, pollable `in_flight_job_id` (async)
  from a non-pollable `in_flight_mode: sync|starting` (adds `in_flight_pollable`), with mode-specific
  guidance (wait out the sync call / retry the poll). `update_infobase_status` also recognizes the two
  sentinels and returns a `not_pollable_sentinel` explanation instead of the bare `Unknown job`.
  (feedback `2026-07-16-update-infobase-sync-job-id-unpollable`)
- **The 300s update ceiling is now a caller-overridable `timeout_s` (60..1800, default 300).** A full-
  schema exclusive update of a multi-hundred-MB+ file infobase can genuinely need longer than 300s; the
  old hard cap aborted it and reported the misleading "held by another process" as the sole cause. The
  `PROCESS_TIMEOUT` message now names both plausible causes (still-restructuring large IB → raise
  `timeout_s`; or a real external holder) and surfaces the Designer PID(s) EDT spawned that may still
  hold the file lock (`designer_pids_still_holding` + `timeout_s` in the payload) — the process is
  *named, not killed*, since killing a Designer mid-restructure would corrupt the update. (feedback
  `2026-07-16-update-infobase-process-timeout-300s-ceiling-reproducible`)
- **Addendum:** the timeout PID field was renamed `aborted_designer_pids` → `designer_pids_still_holding`
  and the message now states the tool did *not* terminate the process and points at `kill_agent_mode=true`
  as the actual-kill lever on retry. Infra verified the old `aborted_*` name was misleading: the surfaced
  Designer PID stayed alive and kept doing real work (CPU climbing) well past the abort, so a caller that
  trusted the `aborted_*` name could race a still-live process. (infra feedback `29d43ab5` /
  `update-infobase-abort-does-not-kill-designer`)
- Unit tests: `EdtUpdateInfobaseErgonomicsTest` (sentinel vs real job id, timeout clamp, `timeout_s`
  parsing, `PROCESS_TIMEOUT` message + non-kill-implying PID key). Build green (`-Plocal-target`).

### BF-12936 (2026-07-16) — `rights_manage` honest reporting + `edt_validate_request` enum sync

- **`rights_manage` no longer reports unconditional success when nothing changed.** Each grant is now
  marked `(changed from X)` vs `(unchanged — already X)`, and the result message says *"No rights changed:
  … nothing was written"* when every grant was a no-op — instead of the old *"Role rights updated: …"* that
  listed every grant as applied regardless. Root cause: the summary line was appended for every grant even
  when `changeObjectRight` was skipped (`currentValue == newValue`), so a stale-model / already-set case
  masqueraded as a write. (feedback `2026-07-16-rights-manage-reports-success-but-does-not-persist`, ask 2)
- **On-disk advisory:** after the export, `rights_manage` reports whether the role's separate
  `Rights.rights` fragment is actually present on disk, and warns (non-fatally) when a change was made but
  the file is missing — the exact recovery-blocking symptom when a `Rights.rights` was deleted on disk under
  a live EDT (a stale in-memory model then accepts grants without re-serializing). Non-throwing on purpose:
  attribute-default-only grants can legitimately serialize no file, so a missing file is a "verify" hint,
  not a guaranteed error. (ask 1 — the deeper "why the fragment isn't rewritten" needs a live-EDT repro.)
- **`edt_validate_request` advertised `operation` enum re-synced with `ValidationOperation`.** The schema
  stopped at `mutate_form_model` and omitted `rights_manage`, `render_template`,
  `create_event_subscription`, `create_information_register` — all accepted by the backend, so a caller had
  to discover `rights_manage` by trial. A new test asserts every `ValidationOperation` toolName is advertised.
  (ask 3)
- Unit tests: `RightsManageMessagesTest` (changed vs no-op summary, no-op message, changed-count, advisory),
  `EdtValidateRequestToolSchemaTest` (enum-in-sync). Build green (`-Plocal-target`, 23/23 across touched
  suites).
- **Persistence fix (scenario "b", root cause — LIVE-VALIDATED on stack-2).** `rights_manage` applied the
  grants to the BM model but never wrote `Rights.rights`. Root-caused over a diagnostic cycle (honest
  reporting → decompile of `BmModelManager.forceExport` → an in-plugin `RIGHTS-DIAG` build): after a role's
  `.rights` file is deleted on disk under a live EDT, `role.getRights()` returns a **dangling
  `RoleDescription` that is no longer a registered top-object** — `getTopObjectByFqn(Role.<name>.Rights)`
  returns null post-commit, so `forceExport`→`createSaveObjectTask` silently skips it (its `result=true`
  comes from the Role/Configuration tasks) → `RightsExporter` never runs → no file. `ensureRoleDescription`
  reused that orphan directly, never calling `attachTopObject`. **Fix:** reuse an existing `RoleDescription`
  only when it is a resolvable top-object (`getTopObjectByFqn` by its external FQN != null); when orphaned,
  fall through to `attachBootstrappedRoleDescription` (the attach path) so a properly registered, exportable
  fragment is created and the grants re-apply onto it. Normal on-disk roles resolve → reused unchanged (no
  regression). Validated live (build `0.1.7.20260716-2008`): `Rights.rights` written for both roles,
  form-identical to a hand-authored role, fragment now resolves (`getTopObjectByFqn`=`RoleDescriptionImpl`),
  responses carry no warning. NB: re-bootstrap applies only the *requested* grants onto the fresh fragment —
  the recovery intent for a file-deleted role. (feedback
  `2026-07-16-rights-manage-reports-success-but-does-not-persist`, ask 1)
- **Content-validation fix — reject a grant on a rights-less type + a `value:remove` escape hatch.**
  `rights_manage` accepted an invalid grant on an `Enum` (a type with no configurable access rights) and
  wrote a stray `<object>Enum.X</object>` block; that block then stalls the platform DB restructure for
  10–20 min on the next `update_infobase` (owner-confirmed real cause of the BF-12936 prod hang; not
  statically diagnosable). Root cause (decompiled `RightsInfoService`): `resolveRight` matched the right by
  NAME against `getRights(object)`, which returns the **global** pool of every right for the runtime version
  (not the object's own rights), so `Read`/`Use` resolved for an Enum even though its `getEClassRights` set
  is empty; the coarse `isMdObjectHasRights` guard can't catch it (Enum's EClass is in
  `ALL_SUPPORTED_RIGHT_ECLASSES`). **Fix (Part 1):** when the rights service is warm (global pool non-empty)
  but the target's own eClass exposes zero configurable rights (`getEClassRights` empty), reject the grant —
  gated on a non-empty global pool so a cold service never yields a false reject; resolution order for
  objects that DO have rights is unchanged (no regression for registers/catalogs/sub-objects). A dual-purpose
  diagnostic logs `globalRights` count vs `eClassRights` names per grant. **Fix (Part 2):** a new
  `value:remove` verb (aliases `clear`/`delete`/`drop`) drops the explicit right entry and prunes the emptied
  `<object>` wrapper (`RightsModelUtil.removeEmptyObjectRights`) — `unset`/`provided` leave the block on disk,
  so removal was previously impossible; `remove` deliberately bypasses the Part-1 guard so an already-written
  stray block can be stripped. Unit tests: `normalizesRemoveAliases` (parsing), `removalSummaryMarksActualRemovalVsNoOp`
  (message). Build green (`-Plocal-target`). (feedback
  `2026-07-16-rights-manage-accepts-invalid-enum-grant-and-cannot-fully-remove-it`)

### Experiment — `mcp-bridge-lite`: strip the in-EDT chat/agent, keep the MCP bridge only

- **Experimental branch `pd/mcp-bridge-lite` (forked from `pd/bsl-tuning`) turns the plugin into a
  lightweight MCP-server-only bridge, removing the entire in-EDT chat/agent/LLM feature (~40% of the
  Java source, ~69k lines).** Delivered in three staged, build-green commits:
  - `c52b62d` (s1) — decouple the MCP host from the agent/LLM engine: drop the `/remote` browser
    companion, the dead agent imports, and the `state` MCP resource; serve static prompt templates.
  - `96d81b7` (s2) — delete the chat/agent UI (`views`/`chat`/`markdown`/`theme`/`editor`/`diff`/
    `statusbar`/`menu`/`remote`/`dialogs`, AI code-action handlers, model/provider preference pages)
    + 18 chat-only jars (flexmark ×16, autolink, annotations); keep the MCP-host prefs + `get_diagnostics`.
  - `6c5fa27` (s3) — delete the core engine: `agent`/`provider`/`session`/`memory`/`skills`/`backend`/
    `remote`/`context`/`feedback`/`streaming`/`evaluation.benchmark`, chat-state, the outbound MCP
    client, and the LLM-wire `model` classes (kept `ToolDefinition`/`ToolCall`); trim
    `VibeCorePlugin`/`ToolRegistry`/`ToolSurfaceContext`/`AgentTraceSession`/`GitService`; drop the
    `llmProvider`/`promptProvider` extension points + 8 jars (langchain4j, langgraph4j, pdfbox, …).
- **What remains:** the MCP host (`mcp/host`, `mcp/model`), the EDT tools (`tools/*`), diagnostics,
  git, permissions, and the host preference/startup UI. Build green (`mvn -Plocal-target -DskipTests
  verify`, 11/11); the 4 host test suites pass (19/19). Plan + review notes: `mcp-bridge-lite-PLAN.md`.
  Not merged to `pd/bsl-tuning` — kept as a self-contained divergent line pending a keep/mainline call.
- **Live-validated** on sandbox EDT 2025.2.3: MCP host binds (`:8764`/`:8767`), `/health` 200,
  `tools/list` (per-endpoint gating) + `tools/call` clean; `get_diagnostics` present, agent tools gone.
- `f252b64` — follow-up fix: the root preference page kept the chat/agent field editors (Max Tool
  Iterations, auto-compaction threshold, …) after their defaults stopped being seeded, so the range
  validators rejected the un-seeded `0` and blocked saving the whole page (incl. MCP-host settings).
  Removed the 6 dead fields; kept the host/QA/terminal/diagnostics ones.

### BF-12705 — get_infobase_sync_state: actionable guidance for the update→still-NOT_EQUAL non-convergence mode

- **The `needs_update` hint no longer sends an agent into a non-terminating `update_infobase` loop.** (this
  commit) A live finding (BF-12705, 2026-07-13) showed a clean `update_infobase updated:true` (zero
  contention, no phantom Designer, no Apache-wsap lock, not dynamic-only-reported) still leaving
  `get_infobase_sync_state` at `NOT_EQUAL`/`work_ready:false` indefinitely — and the old hint ("run
  update_infobase before tests") is not actionable there, so an agent either rabbit-holes or must be told
  out-of-band to ignore `work_ready`. The hint now states that if `update_infobase` already returned
  `updated:true` and the state is still `NOT_EQUAL`, re-running the same update will NOT converge; the
  usual cause is a DYNAMIC apply (main↔DB config diverged until an EXCLUSIVE update) or a not-yet-refreshed
  in-memory equality state; remediation is one exclusive update or treating `work_ready` as advisory for a
  no-schema-impact change. **Honest scope on the "explain the residual delta" ask:** EDT's
  `IInfobaseSynchronizationManager` exposes only the coarse 3-value `InfobaseEqualityState`
  (`EQUAL`/`NOT_EQUAL`/`LOADING`) — there is no object-level "what differs" API at this layer without a
  full Designer-style comparison (which would spawn a configurator and defeat the tool's read-only
  purpose), so surfacing the delta itself is not implemented; the tool instead documents the limitation
  and gives the actionable remediation. Ref:
  `codepilot1c-feedback/2026-07-13-update-infobase-completes-but-equality-state-never-converges-third-mode.md`.

### BF-12839 — mutate_form_model: new `add_form_parameter` op to declare a form-level Parameter

- **`mutate_form_model` now supports an `add_form_parameter` operation** (`{op:"add_form_parameter",
  name, type, [key_parameter], [comment]}`) that creates a `FormParameter` in the form's
  `getParameters()` collection with a resolved value type. (this commit) It is the only tool path to
  declare a form Parameter: `set_form_props` rejects `parameters` as a reference collection
  (`applySimpleFeatureValue` → "Reference property updates are not supported directly"), and
  `add_metadata_child` has no `Parameter` child_kind. Without it a correct
  `OpenForm(..., New Structure("X", ...))` + `Parameters.Property("X")` still tripped the cosmetic
  `unknown-form-parameter-access` diagnostic, which the dev pre-commit gate (0 warnings on touched
  lines) could not clear through the tool surface. The op mirrors `add_command` (non-visual,
  name-keyed, no form-item id); the value type reuses the attribute type-resolver, which was
  generalized from `AbstractFormAttribute` to `EObject` (a `FormParameter`'s `valueType` lives on a
  distinct EReference — `getFormParameter_ValueType()` — and `setTypeDescriptionOnEObject` now resolves
  the generic `valueType` feature). No validation-layer change (the validate path passes `operations[]`
  through verbatim). Source-contract-covered by `AddFormParameterContractTest` (the `Form`/`FormParameter`
  EMF types resolve only in the OSGi runtime, so behavior is validated live).
  Ref: `codepilot1c-feedback/2026-07-14-bf12839-mutate-form-model-no-way-to-declare-form-parameter.md`.

### BF-12839 — connect_infobase: distinguish Designer-agent SSH auth failure from a credential prompt

- **New error code `EDT_DESIGNER_AGENT_AUTH_FAILED`** and a synchronous-path classifier
  (`ConnectInfobaseTool.findDesignerAuthFailureMessage` / `isDesignerAuthFailureMessage`) so a JSch
  `Auth fail` when EDT opens an SSH session to its OWN locally-spawned Designer agent is no longer
  collapsed into `EDT_AUTH_REQUIRED`. (this commit) The new code carries `retry_with:{force:true}` and
  a hint that login/password will NOT help (a fresh `connect_infobase(force=true)` usually rewrites the
  stale/OS-auth-only association and clears it). **Honest scope:** this classifier only fires when EDT
  throws the failure *synchronously*; in the observed BF-12839 case it instead manifested as the 50s
  bind timeout, where no exception reaches the tool and the sub-cause is indistinguishable from a real
  credential prompt at the tool layer.
- **Broadened the misleading `EDT_AUTH_REQUIRED` timeout message + hint.** (this commit) It used to tell
  the caller to "pass login/password" even when login/password were already passed. It now enumerates
  the three real causes (interactive credential prompt / Designer-agent SSH auth failure / unreachable
  server), states that passing creds rules out (a) so (b) is the suspect, and tells the caller to verify
  with `get_workspace_state` before re-binding — EDT's worker may finish the bind after the 50s cap, so
  a reported timeout must not be misread as a broken bind. Addresses the note's "reported failure but the
  bind actually registered" gap without flipping `success:false`→`true` (a stale pre-existing association
  would falsely read as this call's success — worse for a gating agent than a clear "verify first" signal).
- Unit-covered by new cases in `ConnectInfobaseLockDetectionTest` (classifier + enum distinctness).
  Ref: `codepilot1c-feedback/2026-07-14-bf12839-launch-app-hangs-after-designer-agent-sshauth-fail-bind.md`.

### BF-12839 — connect_infobase: non-interactive bind for credentialed file bases (prime access settings before associate)

- **The access-settings modal on a credentialed (re-)bind is fixed at the root: passed credentials are
  now written BEFORE `associate()`.** (this commit) `EdtInfobaseConnectService.finishBind` used to
  `associate()` first and `storeAccessSettings()` last (the BF-13140 creds-last order, which keeps a
  blocked shared secure-storage flush from stranding the primary pointer). But `associate()`
  *synchronously* fires EDT's association event, whose behaviour delegate restores previously-open
  Designer sessions (`connectAndRestoreState → DesignerClient.connect`) using the infobase's *currently
  stored* access settings — still OS/empty at that point, so on a base copied from a credentialed source
  the restore fails to authenticate (JSch `Auth fail`) and EDT raises the native **"Configure Infobase
  Access Settings"** modal on the UI thread. That modal is a hard block on a headless/agent bind
  (escalated to an autonomy blocker after a 3rd recurrence, 2026-07-15). This explains why passing
  `login`/`password` did not prevent the modal: the credentials were written a few lines too late. The
  fix: when explicit credentials are passed, **prime** the access settings before `associate()` so the
  connect-restore authenticates; the authoritative store still runs after (its skip-if-unchanged fast
  path makes it a no-op flush in the common case, and it correctly re-targets a UUID adopted during
  `associate()`'s setDefault retry). The **no-creds path is untouched** — it keeps the BF-13140
  creds-LAST order (nothing useful to prime; primary durability against a blocked secure-storage flush
  preserved). Complements the synchronous `EDT_DESIGNER_AGENT_AUTH_FAILED` classifier above by removing
  the trigger for the credentialed-bind case rather than only reporting it after the fact.
- Regression-covered by `EdtInfobaseConnectFinishBindOrderTest` (pins store-before-associate for
  explicit creds; associate-before-store for the no-creds and blank-login paths). **Live-validated
  PASS** by infra on a real EDT + credentialed file sandbox (2026-07-15, bus report `4eda6a36`): the
  credentialed bind completed with no UI-thread access-settings modal. The autonomy blocker is closed;
  the item #6 residual (headless auto-suppression of the native dialog on *other* paths, e.g. a later
  `update_infobase` under a genuinely-unauthenticable base) is untouched and stays a parked candidate.

  (§ESCALATION 2026-07-15).

### discover_tools: reflect per-endpoint tool gating instead of an unconditional "now available"

- **`discover_tools` now reports category tools the calling endpoint gates out** under an `unavailable`
  array with `available:false` + a `reason`, marks exposed tools `available:true`, and replaces the flat
  "These tools are now available. You can call them directly" note with an honest per-endpoint one. (this
  commit) The announce (`tools/list`), call gate, and `discover_tools` already share one
  `DefaultMcpToolExposurePolicy` per endpoint, so current tip is self-consistent — the infra observation
  (`discover_tools` claimed `yaxunit_run` available while `tools/call` rejected it) was almost certainly a
  **stale deployed build** (the note could not capture the plugin version). This change makes the tool's
  own response unambiguous going forward so a caller never treats a gated tool as callable. Unit-covered by
  `DiscoverToolsGatingTest`. Ref:
  `codepilot1c-feedback/2026-07-14-yaxunit-run-discover-tools-claims-available-but-uncallable.md`.

### BF-12705 — update_infobase: reject a second concurrent update of the same project (double-fire guard)

- **`edt_update_infobase` now refuses a second concurrent (schema) update of the same project while
  one is in flight**, returning a structured `UPDATE_ALREADY_RUNNING` error (with `in_flight_job_id`
  and a hint to poll `update_infobase_status` instead of re-firing). (this commit) EDT applies an
  update through a **single-connection Designer thick-client session**; a re-fired update on the same
  infobase does not run twice — it collides (`Infobase … is already connected`) and can wedge the
  platform. Live finding (BF-12705, 2026-07-10): a headless caller re-fired an async update while the
  first job was still `RUNNING`; the two Designer sessions contended and the update hung ~51 min with
  no clean terminal state. The guard is a process-wide reservation keyed by project name (static, so
  it is shared across tool instances and matches EDT's per-infobase single-connection reality),
  covering **both** the async and synchronous paths; dry runs spawn no Designer session and never
  acquire it. Slot release is identity-checked so a rejected caller can never evict the real holder,
  and a fast-completing async job can never leak the key. New error code
  `EdtToolErrorCode.UPDATE_ALREADY_RUNNING`; unit-covered by `EdtUpdateInfobaseGuardTest` (5 tests,
  green). NB: this addresses the double-fire *trigger*; the separate question of why the existing 300s
  `UPDATE_JOIN_TIMEOUT_MS` cap did not fire under that contention is tracked in the feedback note and
  is most plausibly a symptom of the double-fire itself.

### Q15 — get_infobase_sync_state (project↔IB readiness probe)

- **New read-only MCP tool `get_infobase_sync_state`.** (this commit) Reports whether an EDT
  project is in sync with its primary infobase (`work_ready`) or needs an incremental
  `update_infobase` (`needs_update`), by exposing EDT's in-memory equality state WITHOUT launching
  a configurator/DESIGNER and without mutating anything. Thin facade over
  `EdtRuntimeService.readInfobaseEqualityState` — the same read that backs `update_infobase`'s
  `skip_if_current` (commit `027d623`). Payload: `equality_state`
  (`EQUAL`/`NOT_EQUAL`/`LOADING`/null), `determinable`, `work_ready`, `needs_update`, `loading`,
  plus an actionable `hint`. Best-effort: an undeterminable state (EDT cold / project or primary
  infobase unresolved / API absent on this EDT build) returns `determinable=false` +
  `work_ready=false` — the unknown case must never be read as "ready". Motivated by the
  post-`Move-TaskStack` "Incremental change required" gap (SLC-1 F-MIG-7): lets an automated runner
  gate a destination project on readiness before running tests. `mutating=false`,
  `category=diagnostics`. Answers master Q15 (2026-07-10).

### BF-13140 — connect_infobase: decouple credential save from the primary commit

- **A blocked/failed secure-storage flush can no longer leave a stale primary pointer.**
  (this commit) In a multi-EDT-instance host (the stack model runs N EDT instances sharing
  the per-user Eclipse secure storage), `connect_infobase(set_primary,force)` could trip
  Eclipse's interactive *"secure storage has been modified by another program"* modal on the
  UI thread while EDT flushed the infobase credentials. Because the credential flush ran
  **before** the `associate()`+`setDefaultInfobase()` primary-pointer commit, a blocked modal
  left the `ibases.v8i` entry and the pool lease correct but the project's **primary pointer
  stale** — breaking headless bind (`Provision-Task` Step-Bind, `Move-TaskStack` rebind_dst)
  which cannot dismiss a modal (live-observed on the SLC-1 stack lifecycle test). The connect
  paths (`file`/`standalone`/`server`) now **commit the primary FIRST**, via a shared
  `finishBind()`, then persist credentials **best-effort**: a failed/blocked flush is reported,
  never thrown, so the bind's primary contract is durable regardless. `storeAccessSettings`
  returns a `CredentialOutcome` and classifies the Equinox contention as the new
  `SECURE_STORAGE_CONFLICT` error code (distinct from the slow-handler / generic case). The
  success payload now carries `credentials_persisted` (+ `credentials_error_code` /
  `credentials_warning` when false) so a caller can tell "bound, creds pending" apart from a
  bare timeout. **Residual (not in this change):** a live modal that no one dismisses still
  occupies the handler until EDT's flush unblocks — the source-level cure is a per-instance
  keyring (`-eclipse.keyring <workspace>\.secure_keyring` on each `1cedt.exe` launch); an
  optional async/bounded-flush follow-up is deferred pending live EDT validation. From the AM
  feedback note `2026-07-09-connect-infobase-secure-storage-modal-blocks-headless-multiinstance.md`.

### BF-13140 — file-IB test-client cred default

- **File-IB test runs default the test-client login to `Admin`/`1` instead of the cached
  last-user.** (this commit) When `yaxunit_run` or `qa_run` launches the 1C test client
  against a **file** infobase with NO explicit `test_client_login`/`test_client_password`
  (and no `VANESSA_TEST_CLIENT_*` env), EDT previously fell through to the `.1CD`'s cached
  last-user — inherited via robocopy from the live `File_am`, often a real employee who
  cannot run tests. The client then silently produced no artifacts (`no_report`: no
  `junit.xml` / `yaxunit.log` / `exitcode.txt`) — the root cause of BF-12562. Both tools
  now detect a file infobase and default to the documented file-IB test account
  (`Admin`/`1`, per `test-runners.md`) with a loud `WARN`, so an omitted credential fails
  visibly-correct rather than silently-wrong. **Server infobases are unchanged**: they keep
  using the association's EDT-stored owner credentials (the intended path), and no server
  test credentials are hardcoded. Explicit `test_client_login`/`password` always win, and a
  partially-supplied pair keeps the existing incomplete-creds warning. New shared helpers
  `EdtRuntimeService.isFileInfobase(projectName)` (best-effort, never throws) and the
  package-visible static `isFileConnectionString(connectionString)` back both tools.

### get_workspace_state — on-demand stack-state snapshot

- **New read-only MCP tool `get_workspace_state`.** (this commit) A thin, non-mutating
  facade over `EdtWorkspaceStateService` that returns THIS EDT stack's live state in one
  call — the same snapshot the periodic state-beacon writes to its shared file, but on
  demand over the MCP port. Payload: `beacon_version`, `plugin_version`, `stack_id`,
  `workspace`, `pid`/`host`/`updated_at`, `port`/`profile`, `endpoints`, `index`
  readiness and (optionally) `bound_infobases`. One optional param
  `include_bound_infobases` (default `true`; pass `false` for a faster identity+index-only
  snapshot). Best-effort like the underlying service — it degrades to a partial snapshot
  and never throws when EDT is cold. Carries the same `ToolMeta`
  (`category=diagnostics`, `surfaceCategory=smoke_runtime_recovery`) as `edt_index_status`,
  so it lands on the same tool profiles. For an external orchestrator's stack-pool
  liveness/coordination checks without opening files or the workbench.

### state-beacon — periodic shared stack-state file

- **Opt-in state beacon + a reusable `EdtWorkspaceStateService`.** (this commit) A
  multi-EDT "stack pool" is coordinated by an external orchestrator; each stack's
  plugin now periodically writes a small JSON *beacon* file to a shared directory
  so the orchestrator can read each stack's liveness and basic state WITHOUT
  calling its MCP port. Two pieces:
  - `EdtWorkspaceStateService.buildSnapshot(includeSlowFields)` assembles a
    best-effort snapshot: `beacon_version`, `plugin_version`, `stack_id` (reused
    from `InfobaseLeaseGuard`), `workspace`, `pid`, `host`, `updated_at`, `port` /
    `profile` (from `CODEPILOT1C_PORT` / `CODEPILOT1C_PROFILE`), `endpoints`
    (name/port/enabled per MCP profile), and `index` (derived-data readiness,
    mirroring `edt_index_status`). With `includeSlowFields` it also adds
    `bound_infobases` (each open project's current-context infobases). Every
    sub-part is guarded — a missing service / cold EDT / no-OSGi yields an omitted
    field or an `index:{ready:false,state:"UNKNOWN"}` placeholder, and the builder
    never throws, so a partial beacon appears before the workspace index is ready.
    The EDT-touching probes are gated by a non-blocking service peek so a cold EDT
    never stalls the beacon on the 30 s service-tracker wait.
  - `EdtStateBeacon` (singleton) schedules a 45 s tick on a single daemon thread;
    the first tick fires immediately (partial beacon). `bound_infobases` is
    gathered only on a slow sub-cadence (every 4th tick). The snapshot is written
    atomically (temp file in the same dir + `ATOMIC_MOVE` with a plain-replace
    fallback, copied from `InfobaseLeaseStore.forceTake`) to
    `<state-dir>/<InfobaseLeaseStore.fileNameFor(stackId)>`. On a clean `stop()`
    the scheduler is shut down and the beacon file is deleted, so a stopped stack
    leaves no stale beacon.
  - **Hard opt-in** (mirrors the lease guard): the state dir resolves from env
    `CODEPILOT1C_STATE_DIR`, then the `edt.state.dir` instance preference, else a
    sibling `edt-state` directory next to the pool's lease directory when the
    lease guard is configured. With none set the beacon is a no-op — ordinary
    single-instance users see zero behavior change. Wired into
    `VibeCorePlugin.start()` (async, after the MCP host) and `stop()`.

### update_infobase — opt-in skip when already current

- **`skip_if_current` skips the update when the infobase already equals the
  project configuration.** New optional boolean param (default `false`, so the
  default path is byte-for-byte unchanged). When set, the tool reads EDT's
  in-memory `IInfobaseSynchronizationManager.getEqualityState(project, infobase)`
  BEFORE any pin/lease/webserver side effect; on `EQUAL` it returns
  `{"status":"skipped","skipped":true,"updated":false,"equality_state":"EQUAL"}`
  with a human message and spawns no configurator. Otherwise the normal update
  runs and the success payload carries `skipped:false` plus the observed
  `equality_state` (`NOT_EQUAL`/`LOADING`, or JSON `null` when EDT could not
  determine it). The equality read is best-effort and reflective (matching how
  the service already binds the sync manager); if `getEqualityState` is absent or
  throws, it logs a warning and falls back to a normal update — the pre-check can
  never fail the call.

### fix — expose skip_if_current via edt_diagnostics

- **`skip_if_current` is now reachable from the MCP surface.** (this commit) F1's
  opt-in equality short-circuit was added to `EdtUpdateInfobaseTool`, but that tool
  is not a standalone MCP tool — it is dispatched only through the `edt_diagnostics`
  composite (`command=update_infobase`). The dispatcher forwards the raw parameter
  map to the delegate verbatim, but its own JSON schema did not declare
  `skip_if_current`; MCP clients strip arguments not advertised on the called tool's
  schema (the same root cause as the 2026-05-29 `launch_app` `dry_run` regression),
  so the flag never reached the delegate and the whole feature was unreachable.
  Declared `skip_if_current` (boolean) on the `edt_diagnostics` schema alongside the
  other update-only pass-through params (`keep_connected`, `async`,
  `kill_agent_mode`, `allow_webserver_running`). No forwarding code changed — the
  delegate already reads it and returns the `skipped`/`equality_state` fields
  verbatim. Guarded by an extended `EdtDiagnosticsToolSchemaTest`.

### MCP host — multi-endpoint profiles

- **`CODEPILOT1C_PORT`: launch-time port override for the forced profile.**
  (`2fdd263`, 2026-07-03) Profile definitions are machine-shared; the port was the
  only per-workspace piece and required a GUI preference step per stack. The new
  env `CODEPILOT1C_PORT` (or `-Dcodepilot.mcp.host.profile.port`, which wins)
  overrides the port of the endpoint forced by `CODEPILOT1C_PROFILE`, so a stack's
  start script fully describes its identity (profile + port + stack id + lease
  dir) with no GUI steps. Ephemeral by design: applied at server start only, never
  persisted into the instance's port map; invalid values degrade to the stored
  port with a warning; ignored (with a warning) when no single profile is forced.

### Infobase leases — consumer-review fixes (stack pool, phase 5)

- **`EDT_LEASE_HELD` from connect_infobase/update_infobase carries a structured
  `holder{}`.** (`5f709e5`, 2026-07-03) Previously the holder was only in the message
  text there (manage_leases already returned it structured), so an orchestrator
  building an escalation command had to parse prose for `holder.stack_id`.
  `EdtToolException` now carries an optional flat details map; the two lease guards
  fill it from the holder lease (`InfobaseLease.holderFields()`) and both tools render
  the nested `holder{stack_id,workspace,host,pid}` + `acquired_at`/`branch`. Closes the
  C1 gap for the enforcement tools (consumer feedback 2026-07-03, Q5).

- **`connect_infobase` reconnect errors carry a machine-readable `retry_with{}`.**
  (`aed451b`, 2026-07-03) The migration re-entry dance — `PRIMARY_EXISTS` (add
  `force=true`) followed by `PATH_ALREADY_ASSOCIATED_AS` (reuse the existing
  binding name) — forced orchestrator scripts to parse hint prose. Both error
  payloads now include `retry_with` (`{"force": true}` / `{"infobase_name":
  "<existing>"}`): merge it into the original arguments and re-issue. A silent
  `reconnect=true` mega-flag was considered and rejected — auto-adopting a
  conflicting name would mask exactly the naming drift that produced duplicate
  `ibases.v8i` rows on the polygon. Also: the `manage_leases take` refusal now
  names the requested infobase, not only the branch, when the conflict is
  identity-keyed. Consumer review 2026-07-03, items A1/C1.

- **Leases are keyed by the canonical infobase identity; the branch is an
  attribute.** (`e85d77d`, 2026-07-03) The leased resource is the PHYSICAL
  infobase: phase branches of one task (which share a single per-task IB) now
  contend for one lease file instead of littering the pool with parallel
  branch-keyed claims, a cosmetically different path spelling cannot dodge the
  guard, and a detached HEAD no longer disables enforcement when the infobase is
  known. A branch hop by the holder on the same IB refreshes the lease payload in
  place; re-pointing a branch at a new IB claims a second lease (the old IB stays
  claimed until released). `manage_leases release` resolves by branch-attribute
  scan and refuses an ambiguous match (pass `ib_path`). Driven by the AM-side
  consumer review of the stack-pool brief (2026-07-03, feedback A5).

- **`update_infobase` checks the lease BEFORE the webserver pre-flight.**
  (`e0d059a`, 2026-07-03) On live pools a web server is always running, so
  `UPDATE_BLOCKED_BY_WEBSERVER` masked the more specific `EDT_LEASE_HELD` from a
  non-holder (live polygon observation; consumer review flagged the order as a
  rollout precondition, feedback A1). New `EdtRuntimeService.checkUpdateLease`
  runs first in both the sync and async tool paths; the in-path enforcement
  before the configurator write is unchanged.

### connect_infobase — reliability (stack-polygon live findings)

- **Retry `setDefaultInfobase` once on a fresh association context.** (2026-07-02)
  Live-observed on EDT 2025.2.x: the FIRST bind into a new git-branch association
  context persisted the association file, yet the immediately following
  `setDefaultInfobase` threw "Project ... is not associated with infobase ..."
  (2/2 repro on fresh contexts; an external re-run of the connect always healed).
  Root cause of the silent history: EDT throws a plain `IllegalArgumentException`
  here — NOT `InfobaseAssociationException` (verified against 2025.2.x bytecode) —
  so the historical wrap-and-rethrow never fired at all. `associate()` now catches
  `RuntimeException`, settles briefly, re-adopts the persisted identity, best-effort
  re-persists the reference, re-`associate`s (tolerating its "Infobase ... is already
  connected" complaint — proof the first associate landed) and retries
  `setDefaultInfobase` once — a persistent failure still surfaces as
  `EDT_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`. Regression test: `EdtInfobaseConnectSetDefaultRetryTest`
  (injects the live exception types).
- **Canonical connection-identity matching everywhere.** (2026-07-02) EDT normalizes
  stored connection strings (slash direction, trailing separator, drive-letter case)
  and may re-identify registry rows (different UUID after reload), so the raw
  `equals()` comparison in `findExistingByIdentity`/`adoptExistingAssociationName`
  missed the row the very same call had just added — the retry then hit
  NAME_COLLISION on its own infobase. Identity checks now use the canonical
  `connectionIdentitiesMatch` (previously force-path-only), a UUID mismatch no longer
  short-circuits the connection comparison, and the registry row's UUID is adopted as
  the identity authority over a locally minted one.
- **Assign the infobase UUID BEFORE `add()`; repair legacy `ID=null` rows via
  delete+add.** (2026-07-02) `IInfobaseManager.add()` does not populate the row's
  UUID — the `ibases.v8i` row is written with `ID=null`; `persistReference` then
  assigned a UUID to the in-memory reference only, so every connect minted a NEW
  identity for the same infobase (three different UUIDs observed for one infobase
  across two workspaces and a restart), per-branch associations in different
  workspaces diverged, and association-UUID resolution failed. The row also cannot
  be repaired by direct mutation afterwards — the registry model is transactional
  ("Cannot modify resource set without a write transaction", live-observed). Now
  the UUID is minted before `add()` so the row is stored with a resolvable ID, and
  legacy null-UUID rows are replaced through the manager API (delete + add),
  best-effort. Regression test: `EdtInfobaseConnectPersistUuidTest`.

### Multi-stack pools — infobase lease exclusivity + association surgery (phase 4)

- **Per-branch infobase leases: two EDT instances can no longer work the same file
  infobase.** (2026-07-02) Stack-pool requirement (see the polygon design in
  `stacks\LEASE-DESIGN.md`): tasks = branch + its per-branch IB migrate between EDT
  stacks through a bare git hub, and nothing stopped two stacks from binding/updating
  one IB concurrently. New `InfobaseLeaseStore` (one JSON per branch in a shared
  directory, by convention `<hub>/leases/`; atomic `createFile` claim, atomic-replace
  steal, owner-checked release) + `InfobaseLeaseGuard` decision layer. **Hard opt-in:**
  active only when env `CODEPILOT1C_LEASE_DIR` (or instance pref `infobase.lease.dir`)
  is set — unset means zero behavior change; deliberately no auto-derivation from git
  remotes. Enforcement: `connect_infobase` (all three kinds, before the idempotent
  shortcut) and `update_infobase` (before the configurator writes) refuse with the new
  typed `EDT_LEASE_HELD` (holder + hint in the message) when another stack holds the
  branch — or the same physical IB under another branch (canonical identity match);
  a free lease is auto-taken (bind/update = claim). New `manage_leases` tool:
  status / take (`force` steals, reports the previous holder) / release (`force` drops
  a stale foreign lease). Only branch contexts are leased; detached HEAD/non-git are
  exempt. Tests: `InfobaseLeaseStoreTest` (incl. 16-thread claim race, corrupt-payload
  reads as held), `InfobaseLeaseGuardTest`, `EdtInfobaseConnectLeaseTest`,
  `EdtRuntimeServiceUpdateLeaseTest`, `ManageLeasesToolTest`.
- **`manage_associations` tool: per-branch binding surgery without a checkout.**
  (2026-07-02) list (all contexts with bound IBs, default markers, current-context
  flag) / bind (attach an EXISTING `ibases.v8i` entry to ANY branch's context) /
  copy (replicate one branch's bindings onto another) / dissociate. Grounded against
  2025.2.x bytecode: the git provider builds contexts as
  `InfobaseAssociationContext.of(repo.getFullBranch())` — a public single-segment
  factory — so `refs/heads/<branch>` contexts are synthesizable byte-for-byte
  (`EdtInfobaseAssociationServiceTest` pins the shape). Registry lifecycle stays with
  `connect_infobase` (this tool never creates/repairs v8i rows); bind/copy run under
  the lease guard. Identity helpers extracted to `InfobaseIdentity` (shared by the
  connect service, the association service and the guard).
- **manage_associations: setting a default for a NON-current branch context now works.**
  (2026-07-02, found by polygon scenario 4) EDT quirk, bytecode-verified on
  services.core 21.0.0: the 3-arg `setDefaultInfobase(project, ref, ctx)` validates
  membership against the no-arg `getAssociation(project)` — the CURRENT provider
  context — and uses the `ctx` argument ONLY for the final
  `storeProperty("DefaultInfobase", uuid, ctx)` write, so for any branch that is not
  checked out it always threw "Association does not contain infobase ...". Fixes in
  `setDefaultWithAdoption`: (1) adopt the target context association's own entry
  before the call (ctx-parameterized twin of `adoptExistingAssociationName` — a
  legacy `ID=null` registry row can never match the association entry otherwise);
  (2) when the official API still refuses and the TARGET context's association does
  contain the entry, write the DefaultInfobase property through the manager's own
  private `storeProperty` (reflective) — exactly what the official method does after
  its mis-scoped validation; (3) settle+retry once on the fresh-context read-back
  race (connect-arc pattern). Live-validated: bind into a never-checked-out branch
  lands `Infobases=` + `DefaultInfobase=` under `refs/heads/<branch>`.
  Test: `EdtInfobaseAssociationBindAdoptionTest`.

### MCP host — multi-endpoint profiles

- **Live reload of the shared profiles file + a server-only restart.** (2026-06-29)
  A running server captures its profile snapshot at start and never re-read the
  shared file, so a direct edit of `~/.codepilot1c/mcp-profiles.json` — or an edit
  made in another EDT instance (the file is shared) — only took effect on the next
  full EDT restart, while the preference page preview already showed the new (lower)
  tool count. Two fixes: (1) a background watcher (`McpProfilesChangeMonitor`,
  owned by `VibeUiPlugin`) polls the file and, when it drifts from the live surface,
  prompts to reread + restart the MCP server(s); drift is judged by
  `McpHostManager.signatureOf` vs the last-started signature, so this instance's own
  saves don't nag. (2) A **"Перезапустить MCP-сервер"** action — a button on the
  endpoints preference page and a `1C Copilot ▸ Перезапустить MCP-сервер` command
  (`RestartMcpHandler`) — restarts only the embedded MCP server(s) from saved
  settings, no EDT restart. Backs the "needs EDT restart after a settings change"
  feedback.
- **Profiles are now shared across all plugin instances; only the port is
  per-instance.** (`e58ca92`, 2026-06-29) The profile set — name, tool set, bearer
  token, enabled flag — lives in a per-user file `~/.codepilot1c/mcp-profiles.json`
  (override with `-Dcodepilot.mcp.host.profilesFile` / `CODEPILOT1C_PROFILES_FILE`),
  so every instance/EDT installation of the same user sees the same profiles. Each
  instance keeps only its own port assignment per profile (InstanceScope key
  `mcp.host.profilePorts`); host-level settings (enabled/HTTP/bind/auth/mutation) stay
  per-instance. First load migrates the legacy per-instance profiles (or seeds the
  starter set) into the shared file and records ports. Note: the token now lives in
  the shared file in plain text (was EDT secure storage) — accepted for a
  loopback-bound host.
- **Per-tool picker in the profile editor.** (`e58ca92`, 2026-06-29) The CSV fields
  (enable/disable tools, disable groups, name filter) and the separate preview table
  are replaced by one checkbox tree (groups → individual tools with descriptions),
  with group-cascade tri-state, an "Announced tools: N" counter and a "≥1 tool"
  validation. The endpoints-table Port column is inline-editable (per-instance).
- **`discover_tools` answers strictly per calling port; live tool preview in the
  profile editor.** (`8aa63b6`, 2026-06-27)
- **Endpoints table UI** — add / edit / duplicate / delete / regenerate-token /
  copy-connection / check-status. (`8cf43ec`, 2026-06-26)
- **One EDT serves N MCP ports concurrently**, each a named profile with its own
  port, token and tool set (allowlist/denylist by group + per-tool overrides).
  (`c07f835`, 2026-06-26)
